When questioned, J Moreira stated that DRAGON was not suited by the manner in which the race was run.  He said from barrier 10 it had been hoped that DRAGON may be able to obtain a position with cover behind the speed, however, due to the circumstances of the race in the early stages, he was left racing very wide and for this reason entering the Home Straight on the first occasion he was obliged to allow the horse to stride forward to obtain a position closer to the rail.  He added DRAGON came under pressure from the 600 Metres and then did not finish off its race after this.  A veterinary inspection of DRAGON immediately following the race revealed the horse to be lame in its left front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, DRAGON will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

TOWERING STORM and MOBILE KING were crowded for room on jumping between OCEAN POWER which shifted out marginally and HAPPY CENTENARY which shifted in.
From a wide barrier, DRAGON GLORY was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After the 1600 Metres, MOBILE KING was left racing wide and without cover and after the 1200 Metres was allowed to improve its position to race outside the lead, however, continued to race wide and without cover.
At the 800 Metres, LOVING STAR was checked after attempting to improve between OCEAN POWER and DRAGON GLORY where there was insufficient room.
At the 500 Metres, LOVING STAR raced tight between ZERO ENERGY ACT and TOWERING STORM and close to the heels of OCEAN POWER.
At the 400 Metres, OCEAN POWER was checked away from the heels of FORTUNE GIGGLES.  LOVING STAR, which was following, was hampered in consequence.
Rounding the Home Turn, ZERO ENERGY ACT was awkwardly placed close to the heels of MONEY CAFE.
Near the 250 Metres, TELEPHATIA was momentarily crowded for room inside MONEY CAFE which got its head on the side and shifted in away from MISTER MARC which shifted ground when commencing to weaken.
T H So (ZERO ENERGY ACT) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 250 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of OCEAN POWER, resulting in that horse having to be checked when losing its rightful running between ZERO ENERGY ACT and FORTUNE GIGGLES which shifted in marginally at that time.  T H So was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 9 March 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  This suspension is to take immediate effect.
Near the 200 Metres, ZERO ENERGY ACT shifted out and bumped FORTUNE GIGGLES which became unbalanced.
Passing the 100 Metres, TELEPHATIA shifted out under pressure.
O Doleuze (HAPPY CENTENARY) was reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts out at least hands and heels all the way to the end of the race wherever circumstances permit.
When questioned, J Moreira (NAVEL ORANGE) stated that near the 900 Metres he shifted out into a three wide position and commenced to improve his position in the hope that a runner in advance of NAVEL ORANGE would make a forward move so that he would be able to trail that horse into the race.  He said NAVEL ORANGE took some time to gather momentum and after the 800 Metres he was positioned to the outside of HAPPY CENTENARY which shifted out into a three wide position which resulted in NAVEL ORANGE being left racing in a four wide position without cover.  He said as he was already very wide, with the turn approaching, he felt it was in NAVEL ORANGEâs best interests to try and improve his position to cross runners to his inside so as not to be unnecessarily wide when making the turn into the Straight.  He added it took NAVEL ORANGE some time to improve its position and this resulted in NAVEL ORANGE having to make a sustained run over an extended period of the race.  He said NAVEL ORANGEâs run consequently finished passing the 200 Metres.
After the race, Z Purton stated that he was not able to offer any excuse for the disappointing performance of MONEY CAFE.  He said the horse travelled satisfactorily in the run, however, did not finish off the race as expected when placed under pressure.  A veterinary inspection of MONEY CAFE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, MONEY CAFE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

At the 500 Metres, LOVING STAR raced tight between ZERO ENERGY ACT and TOWERING STORM and close to the heels of OCEAN POWER.
At the 400 Metres, OCEAN POWER was checked away from the heels of FORTUNE GIGGLES.  LOVING STAR, which was following, was hampered in consequence.
Rounding the Home Turn, ZERO ENERGY ACT was awkwardly placed close to the heels of MONEY CAFE.
Near the 250 Metres, TELEPHATIA was momentarily crowded for room inside MONEY CAFE which got its head on the side and shifted in away from MISTER MARC which shifted ground when commencing to weaken.
T H So (ZERO ENERGY ACT) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 250 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of OCEAN POWER, resulting in that horse having to be checked when losing its rightful running between ZERO ENERGY ACT and FORTUNE GIGGLES which shifted in marginally at that time.  T H So was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Monday, 9 March 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  This suspension is to take immediate effect.

When questioned, J Moreira (NAVEL ORANGE) stated that near the 900 Metres he shifted out into a three wide position and commenced to improve his position in the hope that a runner in advance of NAVEL ORANGE would make a forward move so that he would be able to trail that horse into the race.  He said NAVEL ORANGE took some time to gather momentum and after the 800 Metres he was positioned to the outside of HAPPY CENTENARY which shifted out into a three wide position which resulted in NAVEL ORANGE being left racing in a four wide position without cover.  He said as he was already very wide, with the turn approaching, he felt it was in NAVEL ORANGEâs best interests to try and improve his position to cross runners to his inside so as not to be unnecessarily wide when making the turn into the Straight.  He added it took NAVEL ORANGE some time to improve its position and this resulted in NAVEL ORANGE having to make a sustained run over an extended period of the race.  He said NAVEL ORANGEâs run consequently finished passing the 200 Metres.
After the race, Z Purton stated that he was not able to offer any excuse for the disappointing performance of MONEY CAFE.  He said the horse travelled satisfactorily in the run, however, did not finish off the race as expected when placed under pressure.  A veterinary inspection of MONEY CAFE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, MONEY CAFE will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

After the race, D Whyte stated that the only reason he could offer for the disappointing performance of NAVEL ORANGE was that the horse appeared to be reluctant to stretch out when racing inside other runners.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, Z Purton stated that his mount was inclined to lay in in the early and middle stages which is unusual as the horse has always raced tractably when he had ridden it in the past.  He said when the tempo of the race slackened near the 900 Metres, he intended to ease BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE and commence to improve his position.  He said however that as BACKBENCH BLUES was laying in, the horse was reluctant to shift to the outside of VITAL PRINCE and then got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse after the 900 Metres.  He said when he was able to shift BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE, the horse did not improve into the race as he expected it would and because of this he was then left racing three wide and without cover.  He added BACKBENCH BLUES came under pressure prior to the 600 Metres and despite being ridden vigorously between the 500 Metres and the entrance to the Straight, it did not respond and commenced to give ground.  He said BACKBENCH BLUES pulled up very quickly after the race.  He said he was not able to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance other than to say that it is unusual for the horse to lay in the way that it did.  Mr T P Yung, the trainer of BACKBENCH BLUES, stated that whilst the horse had pleased him in the training in the lead up to tonightâs race, the manner in which it weakened out of the race indicated to him that it may be tired and in need of a let-up.  He said he will monitor the horse in the days to come before discussing the matter with the horseâs owners.  A veterinary inspection of BACKBENCH BLUES immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, a favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BACKBENCH BLUES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

After the race, D Whyte stated that the only reason he could offer for the disappointing performance of NAVEL ORANGE was that the horse appeared to be reluctant to stretch out when racing inside other runners.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, Z Purton stated that his mount was inclined to lay in in the early and middle stages which is unusual as the horse has always raced tractably when he had ridden it in the past.  He said when the tempo of the race slackened near the 900 Metres, he intended to ease BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE and commence to improve his position.  He said however that as BACKBENCH BLUES was laying in, the horse was reluctant to shift to the outside of VITAL PRINCE and then got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse after the 900 Metres.  He said when he was able to shift BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE, the horse did not improve into the race as he expected it would and because of this he was then left racing three wide and without cover.  He added BACKBENCH BLUES came under pressure prior to the 600 Metres and despite being ridden vigorously between the 500 Metres and the entrance to the Straight, it did not respond and commenced to give ground.  He said BACKBENCH BLUES pulled up very quickly after the race.  He said he was not able to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance other than to say that it is unusual for the horse to lay in the way that it did.  Mr T P Yung, the trainer of BACKBENCH BLUES, stated that whilst the horse had pleased him in the training in the lead up to tonightâs race, the manner in which it weakened out of the race indicated to him that it may be tired and in need of a let-up.  He said he will monitor the horse in the days to come before discussing the matter with the horseâs owners.  A veterinary inspection of BACKBENCH BLUES immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, a favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BACKBENCH BLUES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

From the outside barrier, PERCY JACKSON was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
Making the turn after the 1000 Metres, TELEPHATIA was awkwardly placed close to the heels of NAVEL ORANGE.
When the pace of the race slackened after the 900 Metres, OXFORD CHARLEY, NAVEL ORANGE and TELEPHATIA all commenced to travel keenly.
Making the turn after the 600 Metres, VITAL PRINCE lay in and was awkwardly placed outside the heels of CRUISE CONTROL.
Approaching the 400 Metres, TELEPHATIA was awkwardly placed close to the heels of VITAL PRINCE.
Near the 250 Metres, BACKBENCH BLUES, which was giving ground, was momentarily eased away from the heels of CRUISE CONTROL.  TELEPHATIA, which was following BACKBENCH BLUES, was shifted out away from the heels of that horse in consequence.
After the race, D Whyte stated that the only reason he could offer for the disappointing performance of NAVEL ORANGE was that the horse appeared to be reluctant to stretch out when racing inside other runners.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, Z Purton stated that his mount was inclined to lay in in the early and middle stages which is unusual as the horse has always raced tractably when he had ridden it in the past.  He said when the tempo of the race slackened near the 900 Metres, he intended to ease BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE and commence to improve his position.  He said however that as BACKBENCH BLUES was laying in, the horse was reluctant to shift to the outside of VITAL PRINCE and then got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse after the 900 Metres.  He said when he was able to shift BACKBENCH BLUES out away from the heels of VITAL PRINCE, the horse did not improve into the race as he expected it would and because of this he was then left racing three wide and without cover.  He added BACKBENCH BLUES came under pressure prior to the 600 Metres and despite being ridden vigorously between the 500 Metres and the entrance to the Straight, it did not respond and commenced to give ground.  He said BACKBENCH BLUES pulled up very quickly after the race.  He said he was not able to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance other than to say that it is unusual for the horse to lay in the way that it did.  Mr T P Yung, the trainer of BACKBENCH BLUES, stated that whilst the horse had pleased him in the training in the lead up to tonightâs race, the manner in which it weakened out of the race indicated to him that it may be tired and in need of a let-up.  He said he will monitor the horse in the days to come before discussing the matter with the horseâs owners.  A veterinary inspection of BACKBENCH BLUES immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of BACKBENCH BLUES, a favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BACKBENCH BLUES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

SWEET BEAN lost its right hind plate passing the 2100 Metres.
Approaching the 1700 Metres, YEUNG SING commenced to prove very difficult to settle and got its head up on a number of occasions when awkwardly placed close to the heels of MOBILE KING.  YEUNG SING then shifted out to avoid the heels of MOBILE KING and was consequently allowed to stride into a more forward position after being left racing wide and without cover.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, MOBILE KING was steadied away from the heels of YEUNG SING which got its head on the side and shifted in away from ENJOY THE GAME.
Near the 400 Metres, ZERO ENERGY ACT was held up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of SWEET BEAN which was held up behind EVER SHINY which came under pressure

When questioned regarding the performance of SWEET BEAN, Z Purton stated that due to the good tempo of the race SWEET BEAN was never able to travel comfortably.  He said he holds some reservations as to whether SWEET BEAN is effective at the 2200 Metres and the tempo of the race did not enable him to give the horse a comfortable run to see out the distance.  He said he attempted to shift to the outside of EVER SHINY near the 500 Metres, however, SWEET BEAN was not travelling well enough to improve at this time and this allowed MOBILE KING to improve around SWEET BEAN.  He added whilst his mount was awkwardly placed close to the heels of EVER SHINY near the 400 Metres, the horse was already under pressure and in the Straight did not respond to his riding.  He said whilst SWEET BEAN was disappointing in tonightâs race, he was of the opinion that there were some factors associated with the horseâs failure to finish off the race.

He added whilst his mount was awkwardly placed close to the heels of EVER SHINY near the 400 Metres, the horse was already under pressure and in the Straight did not respond to his riding.  He said whilst SWEET BEAN was disappointing in tonightâs race, he was of the opinion that there were some factors associated with the horseâs failure to finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of SWEET BEAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SWEET BEAN, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SWEET BEAN will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
SWEET BEAN, SUPER STRIKE and ENJOY THE GAME were sent for sampling.

When questioned, G Mosse stated that as FULL GLORY was having its first start for the season over the 2200 Metres and was drawn barrier 11, he had been asked to shift FULL GLORY across behind runners in the early stages as it was felt that were the horse to be ridden in a forward position, it would then not be able to finish off the race.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he had been asked to ride HOLMES LEGEND positively in the early stages and obtain a forward position if possible.  He said he had to ride HOLMES LEGEND along for some distance in the early stages to cross runners to his inside after being left racing three wide until rounding the Home Turn on the first occasion.  He said after shifting in to race outside YOUNG RANGER, HOLMES LEGEND was inclined to travel keenly and for this reason he allowed the horse to improve into the lead approaching the winning post on the first occasion.

From the outside barrier, HAPPY CONTENDER was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Making the first turn near the 2100 Metres, AUTUMN GOLD momentarily raced tight inside SUPREME FRESH (K Teetan) which shifted in before being directed out to relieve the tightening.  K Teetan was advised to exercise more care in similar circumstances.
Near the 1050 Metres, YOUNG RANGER was awkwardly placed close to the heels of HOLMES LEGEND when SUPREME FRESH improved to be racing outside HOLMES LEGEND.
Near the 150 Metres, REDWOOD BABY and YOUNG RANGER bumped due to both horses shifting ground.  A short distance later, YOUNG RANGER became unbalanced when awkwardly placed outside REDWOOD BABY which initially got its head on the side and shifted out away from SUPREME FRESH and then was taken out by that horse.
When questioned, G Mosse stated that as FULL GLORY was having its first start for the season over the 2200 Metres and was drawn barrier 11, he had been asked to shift FULL GLORY across behind runners in the early stages as it was felt that were the horse to be ridden in a forward position, it would then not be able to finish off the race.
When questioned, Apprentice H N Wong stated that he had been asked to ride HOLMES LEGEND positively in the early stages and obtain a forward position if possible.  He said he had to ride HOLMES LEGEND along for some distance in the early stages to cross runners to his inside after being left racing three wide until rounding the Home Turn on the first occasion.  He said after shifting in to race outside YOUNG RANGER, HOLMES LEGEND was inclined to travel keenly and for this reason he allowed the horse to improve into the lead approaching the winning post on the first occasion.  He added after this HOLMES LEGEND settled better but was still inclined to travel keenly.
ALLCASH lost its right front plate after the race.

                STRIKE EAGLE began awkwardly.
SMART GUY was slow to begin.
When being steadied in the early stages, PERCY JACKSON got its head up on a number of occasions and then shortly after the start became unbalanced after being bumped by GLORIOUS VICTORY.  PERCY JACKSON then shifted in and bumped STRIKE EAGLE which became unbalanced and in turn shifted in, hampering GOOD FIT.
Near the 1700 Metres, TRIBAL GLORY shifted in abruptly towards the heels of COOL PAL.
Near the 1000 Metres, ISLAND FLYER was steadied away from the heels of TRIBAL GLORY which, after drifting out making the turn near the 1050 Metres, then shifted back in.  CASA MASTER, which was following, was shifted out away from the heels of ISLAND FLYER in consequence.
From the 900 Metres, TRIBAL GLORY gave ground abruptly and finished distanced.  A veterinary inspection of TRIBAL GLORY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of TRIBAL GLORY was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, TRIBAL GLORY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Passing the 800 Metres, GLORIOUS VICTORY became unbalanced when having to be shifted out abruptly away from the heels of TRIBAL GLORY which shifted out when giving ground abruptly.
For some distance after the 550 Metres, STRIKE EAGLE was taken back through the field by COOL PAL as that horse weakened abruptly.
After the 500 Metres, GOOD FIT and LOYAL CRAFTSMAN raced tight as both horses improved into tight running between COOL PAL which was continuing to give ground abruptly and CASA MASTER.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to lead on COOL PAL if possible, however, if the horse missed the start as it did at its most recent start, he was instructed to have COOL PAL racing where it was comfortable.  He said COOL PAL began well and he was able to obtain the lead from barrier 1 in the early stages.  He said making the turn approaching the 2000 Metres TRIBAL GLORY commenced to improve its position around COOL PAL and as he did not want COOL PAL to be crossed, he had to ride his mount along to maintain the lead.  He said this resulted in this part of the race being run at a fast tempo.  He said after the 1700 Metres he was able to steady COOL PAL and the horse was then able to travel at a more generous tempo.  He added after the 1200 Metres, being aware that a number of races over the extended distances at Happy Valley had seen horses making mid-race moves, he allowed COOL PAL to continue in the lead at a quicker than normal tempo to ensure that no other runner was enticed to be ridden for the lead.  He said whilst he was not aware that he had opened up a significant margin on the field, he was aware that the race was being run at that time faster than normal, however, he was reluctant to steady the tempo as this may encourage other runners to improve their positions.

Mr A Lee, the trainer of COOL PAL, confirmed the instructions and agreed that COOL PAL had been required to go quicker than hoped, particularly after the 1200 Metres.  M L Yeung was advised that his riding of  COOL PAL between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres, particularly given the earlier sectionals of the race, had lacked judgement and that as an experienced rider he would be expected to ride his mounts in such a manner in the future so as to ensure that they are afforded every opportunity to finish off their race.  A veterinary inspection of COOL PAL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of COOL PAL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.

When being steadied in the early stages, PERCY JACKSON got its head up on a number of occasions and then shortly after the start became unbalanced after being bumped by GLORIOUS VICTORY.

When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to lead on COOL PAL if possible, however, if the horse missed the start as it did at its most recent start, he was instructed to have COOL PAL racing where it was comfortable.  He said COOL PAL began well and he was able to obtain the lead from barrier 1 in the early stages.  He said making the turn approaching the 2000 Metres TRIBAL GLORY commenced to improve its position around COOL PAL and as he did not want COOL PAL to be crossed, he had to ride his mount along to maintain the lead.  He said this resulted in this part of the race being run at a fast tempo.  He said after the 1700 Metres he was able to steady COOL PAL and the horse was then able to travel at a more generous tempo.  He added after the 1200 Metres, being aware that a number of races over the extended distances at Happy Valley had seen horses making mid-race moves, he allowed COOL PAL to continue in the lead at a quicker than normal tempo to ensure that no other runner was enticed to be ridden for the lead.  He said whilst he was not aware that he had opened up a significant margin on the field, he was aware that the race was being run at that time faster than normal, however, he was reluctant to steady the tempo as this may encourage other runners to improve their positions.

After the 500 Metres, GOOD FIT and LOYAL CRAFTSMAN raced tight as both horses improved into tight running between COOL PAL which was continuing to give ground abruptly and CASA MASTER.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he had been asked to lead on COOL PAL if possible, however, if the horse missed the start as it did at its most recent start, he was instructed to have COOL PAL racing where it was comfortable.  He said COOL PAL began well and he was able to obtain the lead from barrier 1 in the early stages.  He said making the turn approaching the 2000 Metres TRIBAL GLORY commenced to improve its position around COOL PAL and as he did not want COOL PAL to be crossed, he had to ride his mount along to maintain the lead.  He said this resulted in this part of the race being run at a fast tempo.  He said after the 1700 Metres he was able to steady COOL PAL and the horse was then able to travel at a more generous tempo.  He added after the 1200 Metres, being aware that a number of races over the extended distances at Happy Valley had seen horses making mid-race moves, he allowed COOL PAL to continue in the lead at a quicker than normal tempo to ensure that no other runner was enticed to be ridden for the lead.  He said whilst he was not aware that he had opened up a significant margin on the field, he was aware that the race was being run at that time faster than normal, however, he was reluctant to steady the tempo as this may encourage other runners to improve their positions.  He added prior to the 700 Metres COOL PAL came under pressure and although the sections of the race had been run quicker than standard, he believed the manner in which COOL PAL weakened indicated to him that the horse must have been experiencing an internal issue.  Mr A Lee, the trainer of COOL PAL, confirmed the instructions and agreed that COOL PAL had been required to go quicker than hoped, particularly after the 1200 Metres.  M L Yeung was advised that his riding of  COOL PAL between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres, particularly given the earlier sectionals of the race, had lacked judgement and that as an experienced rider he would be expected to ride his mounts in such a manner in the future so as to ensure that they are afforded every opportunity to finish off their race.  A veterinary inspection of COOL PAL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of COOL PAL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, COOL PAL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said he was informed that TOP ACE had raced in a prominent position in some of its races over extended distances prior to being imported into Hong Kong.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, due to the circumstances of the race was left racing wide and without cover.  He added he was then unable to shift in behind another runner and consequently TOP ACE remained racing wide and without cover throughout the race and consequently gave ground in the Straight.  A veterinary inspection of TOP ACE immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  The performance of TOP ACE, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, TOP ACE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Near the 2100 Metres, MISTRAL got its head on the side and shifted out despite the efforts of its rider, resulting in PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN being badly crowded for room onto SUPERNATURAL which became badly unbalanced.  After this, MISTRAL continued to lay out.
Near the 1700 Metres, MAC ROW was severely checked when crowded for room inside SMART UNION (N Rawiller) which improved to be racing inside the heels of WIN IT which, after shifting out marginally rounding the Home Turn, then shifted in to resume its position.  In this incident, KERKENI, which was following MAC ROW, was hampered in consequence.  N Rawiller was advised that whilst the Stewards recognised that he steadied his mount during this incident in an attempt to prevent the tightening to MAC ROW, nonetheless he was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he does not place his mounts in positions where interference is likely to occur.
Approaching the 1100 Metres, MAC ROW got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of BO DUKE.

From the outside barrier, SHARP SAILOR was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
After the 2000 Metres, SHARP SAILOR commenced to race keenly and was steadied away from the heels of ALLCASH.
At the 1700 Metres and again passing the 1600 Metres, PRAWN BABA was momentarily awkwardly placed inside the heels of HO HO FEEL which shifted in.
JOLLY GENE and ALLCASH, which raced wide and without cover in the early stages, were both allowed to improve their respective positions closer to the rail approaching the 1200 Metres.
As PRAWN BABA (Z Purton) commenced to improve to the outside of ALLCASH approaching the 600 Metres, ALLCASH shifted out which resulted in both horses making contact.  As a consequence of the contact, PRAWN BABA then lay in which placed ALLCASH in restricted room between PRAWN BABA and outside the heels of JOLLY GENE.  For some distance thereafter, PRAWN BABA continued to lay in as it improved in advance of ALLCASH, causing ALLCASH to be momentarily inconvenienced near the 500 Metres.  HO HO FEEL, which was trailing ALLCASH, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse as it endeavoured to shift out to improve.  Z Purton was advised that whilst the Stewards were satisfied that he made sufficient effort to prevent PRAWN BABA from shifting in in this incident, nonetheless he was reminded of his responsibility to leave comfortable racing room for runners to his inside.
When questioned, O Doleuze (HAPPY CONTENDER) stated that on the first turn he was able to shift in from a four wide position to assume a prominent position behind the leading runners which was in keeping with his instructions.  He said as the race progressed, due to the circumstances of the race, HAPPY CONTENDER was shuffled back to a midfield position albeit trailing PRAWN BABA which was a favoured runner.  He said along the Back Straight when the winner SHARP SAILOR made a forward move, he attempted to shift out to follow that horse, however, VANILLA improved quickly to his outside which prevented him from being able to follow SHARP SAILOR forward into the race.  He added when the tempo then quickened appreciably HAPPY CONTENDER was left flat-footed and took some time to gather momentum before closing off the race well.

UNIQUE JOYOUS began awkwardly.
From the outside barrier, SHARP SAILOR was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
After the 2000 Metres, SHARP SAILOR commenced to race keenly and was steadied away from the heels of ALLCASH.
At the 1700 Metres and again passing the 1600 Metres, PRAWN BABA was momentarily awkwardly placed inside the heels of HO HO FEEL which shifted in.
JOLLY GENE and ALLCASH, which raced wide and without cover in the early stages, were both allowed to improve their respective positions closer to the rail approaching the 1200 Metres.
As PRAWN BABA (Z Purton) commenced to improve to the outside of ALLCASH approaching the 600 Metres, ALLCASH shifted out which resulted in both horses making contact.  As a consequence of the contact, PRAWN BABA then lay in which placed ALLCASH in restricted room between PRAWN BABA and outside the heels of JOLLY GENE.  For some distance thereafter, PRAWN BABA continued to lay in as it improved in advance of ALLCASH, causing ALLCASH to be momentarily inconvenienced near the 500 Metres.  HO HO FEEL, which was trailing ALLCASH, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse as it endeavoured to shift out to improve.  Z Purton was advised that whilst the Stewards were satisfied that he made sufficient effort to prevent PRAWN BABA from shifting in in this incident, nonetheless he was reminded of his responsibility to leave comfortable racing room for runners to his inside.
When questioned, O Doleuze (HAPPY CONTENDER) stated that on the first turn he was able to shift in from a four wide position to assume a prominent position behind the leading runners which was in keeping with his instructions.  He said as the race progressed, due to the circumstances of the race, HAPPY CONTENDER was shuffled back to a midfield position albeit trailing PRAWN BABA which was a favoured runner.  He said along the Back Straight when the winner SHARP SAILOR made a forward move, he attempted to shift out to follow that horse, however, VANILLA improved quickly to his outside which prevented him from being able to follow SHARP SAILOR forward into the race.  He added when the tempo then quickened appreciably HAPPY CONTENDER was left flat-footed and took some time to gather momentum before closing off the race well.

Z Purton was advised that whilst the Stewards were satisfied that he made sufficient effort to prevent PRAWN BABA from shifting in in this incident, nonetheless he was reminded of his responsibility to leave comfortable racing room for runners to his inside.
When questioned, O Doleuze (HAPPY CONTENDER) stated that on the first turn he was able to shift in from a four wide position to assume a prominent position behind the leading runners which was in keeping with his instructions.  He said as the race progressed, due to the circumstances of the race, HAPPY CONTENDER was shuffled back to a midfield position albeit trailing PRAWN BABA which was a favoured runner.  He said along the Back Straight when the winner SHARP SAILOR made a forward move, he attempted to shift out to follow that horse, however, VANILLA improved quickly to his outside which prevented him from being able to follow SHARP SAILOR forward into the race.  He added when the tempo then quickened appreciably HAPPY CONTENDER was left flat-footed and took some time to gather momentum before closing off the race well.

A veterinary examination of LIGHTNING AND GOLD, which became fractious on the float whilst being transported into Happy Valley, found the horse to be suitable to race.  As LIGHTNING AND GOLD was also involved in an incident in the float when being transported back to Sha Tin following its race at Happy Valley on 14 December 2016, the Stewards advised Mr C H Yip, trainer of LIGHTNING AND GOLD, that the horse would not be permitted to be entered for races conducted at Happy Valley in the future.
LIGHTNING AND GOLD shifted out at the start and bumped the hindquarters of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN which became unbalanced.
SWEET BEAN was slow to begin and from a wide barrier was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Shortly after the start, WIN CHANCE shifted out and bumped TELEPHATIA.

Near the 550 Metres, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN was momentarily crowded for room between TELEPHATIA and PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN which got its head on the side and lay in.
At the entrance to the Straight, GARLIC YEAH lay in behind MALAYAN PEARL and was awkwardly placed behind that horse.  TELEPHATIA was brushed by GARLIC YEAH a short distance after this as that horse was directed out away from the heels of MALAYAN PEARL.

As LIGHTNING AND GOLD was also involved in an incident in the float when being transported back to Sha Tin following its race at Happy Valley on 14 December 2016, the Stewards advised Mr C H Yip, trainer of LIGHTNING AND GOLD, that the horse would not be permitted to be entered for races conducted at Happy Valley in the future.
LIGHTNING AND GOLD shifted out at the start and bumped the hindquarters of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN which became unbalanced.
SWEET BEAN was slow to begin and from a wide barrier was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Shortly after the start, WIN CHANCE shifted out and bumped TELEPHATIA.
From wide barriers, BEST JADE TRIUMPH and PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Passing the 2100 Metres, TELEPHATIA was momentarily crowded for room inside LOYAL CRAFTSMAN (J Moreira) which was then shifted out to relieve the tightening to that horse.  J Moreira was advised to exercise more care.
Making the turn near the 2000 Metres, GARLIC YEAH became awkward near the heels of MALAYAN PEARL when being shifted in to obtain cover behind that horse.  In this incident, both LOYAL CRAFTSMAN and TELEPHATIA which were following, were hampered.
Near the 1900 Metres, TELEPHATIA, which was racing ungenerously, shifted out and bumped the hindquarters of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN which became badly unbalanced.
Near the 1800 Metres, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN was awkwardly placed close to the heels of TELEPHATIA.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, WIN CHANCE commenced to travel keenly and got its head up when awkwardly placed behind ISLAND FLYER.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, LIGHTNING AND GOLD was checked away from the heels of SWEET BEAN.
Passing the 850 Metres, TELEPHATIA was shifted out after being awkwardly placed close to the heels of GARLIC YEAH.  SWEET BEAN, which was following, was inconvenienced in consequence.
Near the 550 Metres, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN was momentarily crowded for room between TELEPHATIA and PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN which got its head on the side and lay in.
At the entrance to the Straight, GARLIC YEAH lay in behind MALAYAN PEARL and was awkwardly placed behind that horse.  TELEPHATIA was brushed by GARLIC YEAH a short distance after this as that horse was directed out away from the heels of MALAYAN PEARL.
For some distance approaching the 150 Metres, TELEPHATIA drifted out under pressure, resulting in its rider having to stop riding and straighten the horse passing the 150 Metres.
Whilst the Stewards were satisfied that the riding out of S Clipperton (MALAYAN PEARL), 4th placegetter, did not affect the horseâs finishing position, nonetheless he was reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts out with sufficient vigour so as not to leave his riding open to query.  S Clipperton was advised that the Stewards had previously spoken to him on a number of occasions about his riding out of horses over the concluding stages.
When questioned, J Moreira stated that after being required to race wide and without cover throughout the race, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN became unbalanced when tightened near the 550 Metres.  He said after this LOYAL CRAFTSMAN appeared to lose interest in the race and gave ground noticeably in the Home Straight.  A veterinary inspection of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, which finished tailed out when favourite for tonightâs race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SWEET BEAN, B Prebble stated that he was not able to offer any reason for the manner in which the horse gave ground from the 500 Metres.  He said its last start success was achieved on the All Weather Track and it may be that the horse appreciated that surface more so than tonightâs surface, but irrespective SWEET BEAN shortened stride from the 500 Metres to finish at the tail of the field.  A veterinary inspection of SWEET BEAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SWEET BEAN, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, SWEET BEAN will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
A veterinary inspection of PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, GARLIC YEAH and TELEPHATIA were sent for sampling.
<3/2/2017  Additional Veterinary Report>PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said at that time there were no significant findings.  PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer T P Yung this morning.  He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its right front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                At declaration time, Z Purton was declared as the rider of both GARLIC YEAH and FANCY MUSIC.  It was established that Z Purton had a firm commitment to GARLIC YEAH.  As such, the Stewards permitted N Callan to be substituted as the rider of FANCY MUSIC.  For this declaration error, Trainer P OâSullivan was fined $2,000.
BEST REWARD was withdrawn on 11.3.17 by order of the Stewards acting on veterinary advice (lame right fore).  Before being allowed to race again, BEST REWARD will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
FANCY MUSIC proved quite reluctant to proceed to the Start.  Trainer P OâSullivan was advised that the Stewards would monitor FANCY MUSICâs pre-race behaviour in the future before deciding if any further action was necessary.
After being loaded into the barriers, the bridle fitted to FANCY MUSIC came loose, resulting in the bridle having to be refitted.
GORGEOUS AGAIN was slow to begin.
From the outside barriers, FANCY MUSIC and TELEPHATIA were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
BLAZING PASS and AMRITSARIA bumped heavily at the start.  A short distance later, KING BOUNTIFUL was severely checked when crowded for room between AMRITSARIA which shifted out after making contact with BLAZING PASS and JE PENSE which was taken in by GARLIC YEAH.  In this incident, both AMRITSARIA and JE PENSE were also badly hampered.
A short distance after the start, AMRITSARIA was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GARLIC YEAH.  After this, AMRITSARIA proved very difficult to settle and approaching the winning post on the first occasion shifted in away from GORGEOUS AGAIN, resulting in BLAZING PASS being crowded for room for some distance.
After being crossed by GORGEOUS AGAIN near the 1800 Metres, AMRITSARIA continued to travel fiercely, resulting in JE PENSE, which was following, being checked away from the heels of AMRITSARIA in consequence.
Approaching the 1700 Metres, AMRITSARIA shifted out away from the heels of GORGEOUS AGAIN, resulting in TELEPHATIA being bumped and taken wider.
After the 1600 Metres, TELEPHATIA was left racing wide and without cover.
Passing the 500 Metres, GORGEOUS AGAIN was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GOOD FIT.
Passing the 400 Metres, SUPER FORM was steadied when initially disappointed for running between PREMIUM CHAMPION and GOOD FIT which shifted in.  SUPER FORM was then held up for clear running for a short distance after this.
Also passing the 400 Metres, GARLIC YEAH was awkwardly placed close to the heels of GORGEOUS AGAIN.
At the 300 Metres, BLAZING PASS was checked when disappointed for running between AMRITSARIA and TELEPHATIA which was giving ground abruptly.  In this incident, BLAZING PASS bumped AMRITSARIA.
After the 150 Metres, GORGEOUS AGAIN shifted out under pressure.  GARLIC YEAH, which was racing outside GORGEOUS AGAIN, shifted out and away from that horse.
Approaching the 50 Metres, GOOD FIT was steadied away from the heels of PREMIUM CHAMPION which shifted out.
Close to the finishing line, SUPER FORM and PREMIUM CHAMPION raced tight.

On the first turn near the 2000 Metres, LUCKY SEBRING shifted out and made contact with WEALTHY FORTUNE.
After leaving the 2000 Metres, STORM KID commenced to prove very difficult to settle, shifted out and made contact with the hindquarters of SWEET BEAN.  STORM KID continued to over-race badly and approaching the 1800 Metres was shifted out from behind SWEET BEAN and in so doing clipped the heels of that horse and blundered.  STORM KID was then allowed to stride forward to assume the lead at the winning post on the first occasion.
When the pace slackened near the 1300 Metres, TELEPHATIA commenced to over-race and was checked away from the heels of SWEET BEAN.  In this incident, TELEPHATIA shifted out, resulting in ALWAYS WONGCHOY being taken out and becoming awkwardly placed on the heels of PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN.  TELEPHATIA, which was proving difficult to manage, then shifted back in, resulting in LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, which had improved to its inside, being checked.  As the Stewards were satisfied that the slowing of the pace and the racing manners of TELEPHATIA had been the primary cause of the incident, no further action was taken.
Also near the 1300 Metres, WEALTHY FORTUNE was shifted out from behind AUDACITY and allowed to improve its position around that horse.  When WEALTHY FORTUNE shifted out, PRECISIONCRAFTSMAN was taken wider and consequently obliged to race wide and without cover for the remainder of the event.

                On arrival at the Start, WEALTHY FORTUNE, which made contact with a rail on leaving the Parade Ring, was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.
ALWAYS WONGCHOY began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between PREMIUM CHAMPION and CHARITY PLENTY, both of which shifted ground.  In this incident, PREMIUM CHAMPION became unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by ALWAYS WONGCHOY.
Shortly after the start, TELEPHATIA shifted out and bumped EASTERN PROWESS.
From a wide barrier, JE PENSE was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
After travelling about 50 Metres, PREMIUM CHAMPION was crowded for room between CHARITY PLENTY and LOYAL CRAFTSMAN which shifted out away from AMRITSARIA.
Making the turn near the 2100 Metres, CHARITY PLENTY was momentarily crowded for room between GLORY STAR and STORM KID.  GLORY STAR was then shifted out to relieve the tightening to CHARITY PLENTY.
Passing the 600 Metres, PREMIUM CHAMPION raced in restricted room between CHARITY PLENTY and TELEPHATIA after improving into tight running between those horses.  In this incident, CHARITY PLENTY, which was commencing to give ground, was inconvenienced when racing tight inside JE PENSE.  The performance of CHARITY PLENTY, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CHARITY PLENTY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Passing the 200 Metres, TELEPHATIA was awkwardly placed inside AMRITSARIA.
When questioned, O Doleuze stated that he had been instructed to lead on WEALTHY FORTUNE as it was felt that the race would be run at a slow tempo.  He said WEALTHY FORTUNE does not have early speed and it was felt that the horse, from the wide barrier, would be unlikely to assume the outright lead in the early stages.  He said it was anticipated that the tempo of the race would slow in the Home Straight on the first occasion as most of the runners would have assumed their positions by this time.  He said he therefore felt that this would provide WEALTHY FORTUNE with an opportunity to improve towards the lead.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, as he expected, WEALTHY FORTUNE did not show sufficient early speed to lead the race.  He said although an opportunity presented itself for WEALTHY FORTUNE to possibly obtain cover behind LOYAL CRAFTSMAN near the 1800 Metres, because of his instructions, he was reluctant to take this option.  He said GLORY STAR was going forward of WEALTHY FORTUNE at this time and he was hoping to follow that horse forward with a view to possibly shifting in to race to its outside after it obtained the lead.

When questioned, O Doleuze stated that he had been instructed to lead on WEALTHY FORTUNE as it was felt that the race would be run at a slow tempo.  He said WEALTHY FORTUNE does not have early speed and it was felt that the horse, from the wide barrier, would be unlikely to assume the outright lead in the early stages.  He said it was anticipated that the tempo of the race would slow in the Home Straight on the first occasion as most of the runners would have assumed their positions by this time.

He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, as he expected, WEALTHY FORTUNE did not show sufficient early speed to lead the race.  He said although an opportunity presented itself for WEALTHY FORTUNE to possibly obtain cover behind LOYAL CRAFTSMAN near the 1800 Metres, because of his instructions, he was reluctant to take this option.  He said GLORY STAR was going forward of WEALTHY FORTUNE at this time and he was hoping to follow that horse forward with a view to possibly shifting in to race to its outside after it obtained the lead.

He added the tempo of the race increased further after the 1200 Metres and WEALTHY FORTUNE was not travelling as strongly as it did last start when he shifted the horse out mid-race to improve due to how well the horse was travelling.  He said he had to niggle at WEALTHY FORTUNE in the middle stages to maintain its position and he was not able to quicken with LOYAL CRAFTSMAN when that horse improved its position in advance of WEALTHY FORTUNE passing the 700 Metres.  He said after this WEALTHY FORTUNE did not finish off the race as expected.  After considering the matter, in particular the sectional times during the relevant periods of the race, no further action was taken.

ALWAYS WONGCHOY began only fairly and shortly after the start was crowded for room between PREMIUM CHAMPION and CHARITY PLENTY, both of which shifted ground.  In this incident, PREMIUM CHAMPION became unbalanced after being bumped on the hindquarters by ALWAYS WONGCHOY.
Shortly after the start, TELEPHATIA shifted out and bumped EASTERN PROWESS.
From a wide barrier, JE PENSE was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
After travelling about 50 Metres, PREMIUM CHAMPION was crowded for room between CHARITY PLENTY and LOYAL CRAFTSMAN which shifted out away from AMRITSARIA.
Making the turn near the 2100 Metres, CHARITY PLENTY was momentarily crowded for room between GLORY STAR and STORM KID.  GLORY STAR was then shifted out to relieve the tightening to CHARITY PLENTY.
Passing the 600 Metres, PREMIUM CHAMPION raced in restricted room between CHARITY PLENTY and TELEPHATIA after improving into tight running between those horses.  In this incident, CHARITY PLENTY, which was commencing to give ground, was inconvenienced when racing tight inside JE PENSE.  The performance of CHARITY PLENTY, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CHARITY PLENTY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
Passing the 200 Metres, TELEPHATIA was awkwardly placed inside AMRITSARIA.
When questioned, O Doleuze stated that he had been instructed to lead on WEALTHY FORTUNE as it was felt that the race would be run at a slow tempo.  He said WEALTHY FORTUNE does not have early speed and it was felt that the horse, from the wide barrier, would be unlikely to assume the outright lead in the early stages.  He said it was anticipated that the tempo of the race would slow in the Home Straight on the first occasion as most of the runners would have assumed their positions by this time.  He said he therefore felt that this would provide WEALTHY FORTUNE with an opportunity to improve towards the lead.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode his mount along in the early stages, however, as he expected, WEALTHY FORTUNE did not show sufficient early speed to lead the race.  He said although an opportunity presented itself for WEALTHY FORTUNE to possibly obtain cover behind LOYAL CRAFTSMAN near the 1800 Metres, because of his instructions, he was reluctant to take this option.
