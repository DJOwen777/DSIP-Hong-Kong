WRATH OF FIRE began awkwardly and lost ground on jumping.
LUCKY OMENS also began awkwardly, shifted out at the start and was awkwardly placed inside the hindquarters of PO CHING TREASURE.
PO CHING TREASURE and WAYFOONG EXPRESS made contact at the start.  Then shortly after the start, PO CHING TREASURE shifted out and again bumped WAYFOONG EXPRESS.
From a wide barrier, LEVEL PLAYER was shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
AMBITIOUS CHAMPION had difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
LUCKY OMENS was held up and unable to obtain clear running until after the 300 Metres.
Near the 150 Metres, PO CHING TREASURE, which was giving ground, shifted in and brushed the running rail.
Approaching the 100 Metres, WEALTHY FORTUNE was awkwardly placed outside the heels of VANILLA which shifted out marginally under pressure.
Throughout the race, WEALTHY FORTUNE travelled wide and without cover.
N Callan (AMBASSADORSHIP) was reminded of his obligation not to raise his whip arm above shoulder height.
When questioned, M Chadwick (OCEAN POWER) stated that he had been asked to take up a forward position from the outside barrier if possible, however, if OCEAN POWER did not show sufficient speed, he should attempt to obtain a position with cover.  He said in accordance with his instructions, he rode his mount along in the early stages and shortly after the start became aware that VANILLA was being aggressively ridden to his inside.  He said he felt that he would have had to make too much use of OCEAN POWER to continue forward, therefore he steadied his mount with a view to obtaining cover behind that horse.  He said this resulted in OCEAN POWER having to race further back in the field than had been anticipated.  He said passing the 1600 Metres he was left racing in a three wide position outside WAYFOONG EXPRESS, however, he had cover.  He added passing the 1400 Metres WAYFOONG EXPRESS was shifted out away from the heels of AMBASSADORSHIP into a three wide position which resulted in OCEAN POWER being taken wider, therefore he elected to steady his mount and obtain a position with cover behind WAYFOONG EXPRESS rather than racing unnecessarily wide.  He said OCEAN POWER did not travel comfortably at any stage and was under pressure as far out as the 800 Metres.  A veterinary examination of OCEAN POWER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

CRUISE CONTROL had difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight and then when closing off the race strongly raced tight between DRAGON BACHELOR and AXIOM when attempting to improve into tight running between those horses.  Then passing the 150 Metres, CRUISE CONTROL was steadied and shifted to the inside of DRAGON BACHELOR after being disappointed for running between that horse and AXIOM which also had difficulty obtaining clear running over the final 200 Metres.

At the same time, MALAYAN PEARL shifted out, resulting in REAL GENERAL being checked when crowded for room and blundering.  Whilst this incident was one of some significance, as the Stewards were of the view that there was no rider error involved, no further action was taken.  When REAL GENERAL was checked, TOWERING STORM shifted in abruptly away from the heels of that horse near the 350 Metres and bumped LETâS GOAL, resulting in TOWERING STORM becoming badly unbalanced.

When being steadied in the early stages in order to be shifted across behind runners from a wide barrier, ARCHIPPUS got its head up on a number of occasions.
At the 500 Metres, WILLIE INVICTUS (K C Leung) shifted out and bumped AXIOM, resulting in both horses becoming unbalanced.  TRAVEL SUPER in turn was shifted out away from the heels of AXIOM and bumped SELKIRK STAR, resulting in that horse being hampered and taken wider.  K C Leung was advised to exercise more care when shifting ground.
Rounding the Home Turn, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION was awkwardly placed close to the heels of INDUSTRIALIST WAY.
Over the concluding stages, SUPREME FRESH was awkwardly placed when racing tight between AMBITIOUS CHAMPION and INDUSTRIALIST WAY which shifted out marginally under pressure.
In the Straight, TRAVEL SUPER hung in and proved difficult to ride.
For the majority of the race, AXIOM travelled wide and without cover.
U Rispoli (BEST SHOW) was again reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts out at least hands and heels to the end of the race where circumstances permit.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SELKIRK STAR, W M Lai stated that, as instructed and consistent with its previous races, he shifted SELKIRK STAR across behind runners in the early stages from the wide barrier.  He said although SELKIRK STAR was required to race in a three wide position for the majority of the race, the horse at all times had cover and travelled comfortably in the early and middle stages.  He said SELKIRK STAR continued to travel well until after the 500 Metres at which time the horse became unbalanced after being bumped by TRAVEL SUPER.  He said after this, he balanced SELKIRK STAR back up and immediately placed the horse under pressure, however, it did not respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SELKIRK STAR immediately following the race revealed the horse to have a continuous epiglottic entrapment.
A veterinary inspection of FRANCE VALOUR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

At the 500 Metres, WILLIE INVICTUS (K C Leung) shifted out and bumped AXIOM, resulting in both horses becoming unbalanced.  TRAVEL SUPER in turn was shifted out away from the heels of AXIOM and bumped SELKIRK STAR, resulting in that horse being hampered and taken wider.  K C Leung was advised to exercise more care when shifting ground.
Rounding the Home Turn, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION was awkwardly placed close to the heels of INDUSTRIALIST WAY.
Over the concluding stages, SUPREME FRESH was awkwardly placed when racing tight between AMBITIOUS CHAMPION and INDUSTRIALIST WAY which shifted out marginally under pressure.

U Rispoli (BEST SHOW) was again reminded of his obligation to ride his mounts out at least hands and heels to the end of the race where circumstances permit.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SELKIRK STAR, W M Lai stated that, as instructed and consistent with its previous races, he shifted SELKIRK STAR across behind runners in the early stages from the wide barrier.  He said although SELKIRK STAR was required to race in a three wide position for the majority of the race, the horse at all times had cover and travelled comfortably in the early and middle stages.  He said SELKIRK STAR continued to travel well until after the 500 Metres at which time the horse became unbalanced after being bumped by TRAVEL SUPER.  He said after this, he balanced SELKIRK STAR back up and immediately placed the horse under pressure, however, it did not respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SELKIRK STAR immediately following the race revealed the horse to have a continuous epiglottic entrapment.
A veterinary inspection of FRANCE VALOUR immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, the horse was unable to be scoped due to being fractious.

As the Stewards were of the opinion that there were a number of circumstances involved in this incident, principally that REDKIRK WARRIOR was improving into restricted room, they took no further action other than to advise both Jockeys Teetan and Doleuze to ensure that they make every endeavour to prevent their mounts from shifting ground and causing interference to other runners.

K Teetan was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 250 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of REDKIRK WARRIOR, resulting in that horse being taken in onto the hindquarters of OBLITERATOR, being checked and losing the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  Having considered the circumstances of this incident and the status of the race, the Stewards believed it was appropriate for K Teetanâs licence to ride in races to be suspended for a period to expire on Thursday, 2 April 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Saturday, 21 March 2015.
When questioned, C Soumillon stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on OBLITERATOR if possible from its favourable draw.

He said when CONTENTMENT improved to his outside near the 1600 Metres OBLITERATOR commenced to travel keenly, however, passing the 1200 Metres he was able to steady the tempo on OBLITERATOR.

As the Stewards were of the opinion that there were a number of circumstances involved in this incident, principally that REDKIRK WARRIOR was improving into restricted room, they took no further action other than to advise both Jockeys Teetan and Doleuze to ensure that they make every endeavour to prevent their mounts from shifting ground and causing interference to other runners.
Passing the 350 Metres, BEAUTY ONLY was bumped by GOT FLY which shifted to the outside of GIANT TREASURE into clear running.
K Teetan was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 250 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of REDKIRK WARRIOR, resulting in that horse being taken in onto the hindquarters of OBLITERATOR, being checked and losing the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  Having considered the circumstances of this incident and the status of the race, the Stewards believed it was appropriate for K Teetanâs licence to ride in races to be suspended for a period to expire on Thursday, 2 April 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (3 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Sha Tin racemeeting on Saturday, 21 March 2015.
When questioned, C Soumillon stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on OBLITERATOR if possible from its favourable draw.  He said in accordance with his instructions he rode OBLITERATOR along in the early stages and was able to obtain a position on the rail in the lead after the 1800 Metres.  He said when CONTENTMENT improved to his outside near the 1600 Metres OBLITERATOR commenced to travel keenly, however, passing the 1200 Metres he was able to steady the tempo on OBLITERATOR.  He added the horse came under heavy pressure rounding the Home Turn and then did not finish off its race.

                On arrival at the Start, it was noted that SPICY SIAM had lost its left front plate.  This plate was refitted.  SPICY SIAM was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.

After the 800 Metres, OXFORD CHARLEY was awkwardly placed close to the heels of PERCY JACKSON.
Throughout the race, OCEAN POWER travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight gave ground.
When questioned, A Suborics (RUGBY AMBASSADOR) stated that approaching the 1600 Metres he was able to shift in to race outside the leader BETTER ANNOUNCE.  He said he attempted to steady RUGBY AMBASSADOR to maintain this position, however, RUGBY AMBASSADOR commenced to prove difficult to settle and was inclined to travel keenly.  He said when it appeared that BETTER ANNOUNCE was being steadied to slow the tempo after the 1500 Metres, he allowed RUGBY AMBASSADOR to improve its position forward of that horse after the 1400 Metres and to take the outright lead near the 1200 Metres.  He said after allowing RUGBY AMBASSADOR to cross into the lead, the horse settled better and for this reason he was reluctant to further steady RUGBY AMBASSADOR as it was travelling comfortably.  He added although this resulted in the race being run at a slightly faster sectional than he had hoped between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres, he felt it was better to allow the horse to use its action rather than have it travel keenly.
When questioned regarding his riding of OXFORD CHARLEY in the Straight, O Doleuze stated that in the early part of the Straight he rode his mount aggressively to improve inside PERCY JACKSON.  He said however that when OXFORD CHARLEY was hampered near the 300 Metres when PERCY JACKSON shifted in, he was obliged to steady his mount.  He said he then positioned OXFORD CHARLEY behind PERCY JACKSON in order to establish whether clear running would become available to the inside of that horse and behind RUGBY AMBASSADOR or to the outside of PERCY JACKSON and behind BETTER ANNOUNCE.

When questioned, A Suborics (RUGBY AMBASSADOR) stated that approaching the 1600 Metres he was able to shift in to race outside the leader BETTER ANNOUNCE.  He said he attempted to steady RUGBY AMBASSADOR to maintain this position, however, RUGBY AMBASSADOR commenced to prove difficult to settle and was inclined to travel keenly.  He said when it appeared that BETTER ANNOUNCE was being steadied to slow the tempo after the 1500 Metres, he allowed RUGBY AMBASSADOR to improve its position forward of that horse after the 1400 Metres and to take the outright lead near the 1200 Metres.  He said after allowing RUGBY AMBASSADOR to cross into the lead, the horse settled better and for this reason he was reluctant to further steady RUGBY AMBASSADOR as it was travelling comfortably.  He added although this resulted in the race being run at a slightly faster sectional than he had hoped between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres, he felt it was better to allow the horse to use its action rather than have it travel keenly.
When questioned regarding his riding of OXFORD CHARLEY in the Straight, O Doleuze stated that in the early part of the Straight he rode his mount aggressively to improve inside PERCY JACKSON.  He said however that when OXFORD CHARLEY was hampered near the 300 Metres when PERCY JACKSON shifted in, he was obliged to steady his mount.  He said he then positioned OXFORD CHARLEY behind PERCY JACKSON in order to establish whether clear running would become available to the inside of that horse and behind RUGBY AMBASSADOR or to the outside of PERCY JACKSON and behind BETTER ANNOUNCE.  He said as RUGBY AMBASSADOR appeared to be stopping, he committed OXFORD CHARLEY to the outside of PERCY JACKSON after the 200 Metres, however, after this OXFORD CHARLEY was not able to obtain clear running due to ALWAYS SOMETHING being positioned to the outside of BETTER ANNOUNCE.  O Doleuze was advised that his riding particularly over the final 300 Metres had come under notice in that it had lacked the necessary urgency expected of a rider.  He was advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to improve into runs as they become available and accordingly be fully tested wherever possible.  A veterinary inspection of OXFORD CHARLEY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of FORTUNE GIGGLES immediately following the race including an endoscopic examination showed a substantial amount of mucopus in the horseâs trachea.  The performance of FORTUNE GIGGLES, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FORTUNE GIGGLES will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in an official barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

For some distance approaching the 600 Metres, SPEEDY WALLY, which was inclined to lay in, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of NAVEL ORANGE.  SPEEDY WALLY then shifted out abruptly when being checked away from the heels of NAVEL ORANGE passing the 600 Metres and made contact with the hindquarters of PERCY JACKSON which became badly unbalanced.  GOOD FIT, which was following, was hampered in consequence.
OXFORD CHARLEY was held up behind the tiring GRASSLAND DRAGON rounding the Home Turn.
Approaching and passing the 300 Metres, OCEAN POWER was awkwardly placed close to the heels of WIN ALONG (H W Lai) which shifted in.  H W Lai was advised to exercise more care.
Over the concluding stages, AMBASSADORSHIP raced in restricted room between PERCY JACKSON and TELEPHATIA.
Throughout the race, GRASSLAND DRAGON raced with its head on the side and lay out.
Also throughout the race, PERCY JACKSON travelled wide and without cover.
A veterinary inspection of GOOD FIT immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
A veterinary inspection of TELEPHATIA immediately following the race did not show any significant findings, however, only a partial endoscopic examination was able to be performed.

Near the 800 Metres, FULL GLORY shifted out away from the heels of FRANCE VALOUR when travelling keenly.
Passing the 700 Metres, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION was checked and lost ground after improving into tight running inside FULL GLORY (G Mosse) which then shifted back in marginally when awkwardly placed close to the heels of THE SYLPH.  G Mosse was reprimanded and advised that whilst there were some circumstances to this incident, nonetheless he would be expected to ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground and causing interference to other runners.  When AMBITIOUS CHAMPION was checked, SERGEANT TITANIUM was checked out away from the heels of that horse in consequence, resulting in SO CAFFE being crowded for room inside WRATH OF FIRE.

FULL GLORY was held up for clear running rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight.
Near the 75 Metres, HAPPY ROCKY was shifted out away from TURBO JEWELLERY which shifted out marginally under pressure.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to ride HOLMES LEGEND behind midfield from barrier 10 if possible.  He said HOLMES LEGEND began better than expected and he immediately commenced to take hold of his mount in order to shift across behind runners.  He said INDUSTRIALIST WAY, which was drawn immediately inside HOLMES LEGEND, began only fairly and then took a considerable time to muster speed and because of this he was not able to immediately steady HOLMES LEGEND and shift across behind that runner, this resulted in HOLMES LEGEND being left racing in a forward position in the early stages which had not been anticipated.  He added he was also left racing wide passing the winning post on the first occasion and near the 1700 Metres steadied his mount in order to obtain a position behind INDUSTRIALIST WAY.  He said he was not able to bring HOLMES LEGEND back behind that horse prior to SUPREME FRESH improving its position to be racing inside HOLMES LEGEND.  He said therefore he was obliged to let SUPREME FRESH to improve its position and he was able to obtain cover behind that horse after the 1200 Metres but was still left racing wide.  A veterinary inspection of HOLMES LEGEND immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SERGEANT TITANIUM, J Moreira stated that despite being ridden along in the early stages, his mount did not show any early speed and consequently was required to race further back in the field than had been hoped.  He said SERGEANT TITANIUM travelled satisfactorily in the early and middle stages, however, lost momentum when having to be checked away from the heels of AMBITIOUS CHAMPION after the 700 Metres.  He said it was at this stage that other runners were improving into the race and not being able to improve at this time meant that SERGEANT TITANIUM was going to find it difficult then to finish off the race.  He added SERGEANT TITANIUM gave him a limited response when placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn, however, was disappointing in its failure to close off the race over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of SERGEANT TITANIUM immediately following the race found the horse to have sustained a small wound to the right front leg, however, an endoscopic examination was not able to be conducted due to it being fractious.
A veterinary inspection of AMBITIOUS CHAMPION immediately following the race revealed the horse to have sustained minor lacerations to both front legs.  Before being allowed to race again, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

He said it was at this stage that other runners were improving into the race and not being able to improve at this time meant that SERGEANT TITANIUM was going to find it difficult then to finish off the race.  He added SERGEANT TITANIUM gave him a limited response when placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn, however, was disappointing in its failure to close off the race over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of SERGEANT TITANIUM immediately following the race found the horse to have sustained a small wound to the right front leg, however, an endoscopic examination was not able to be conducted due to it being fractious.
A veterinary inspection of AMBITIOUS CHAMPION immediately following the race revealed the horse to have sustained minor lacerations to both front legs.  Before being allowed to race again, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned, N Rawiller stated that he had been asked to ride HOLMES LEGEND behind midfield from barrier 10 if possible.

He added he was also left racing wide passing the winning post on the first occasion and near the 1700 Metres steadied his mount in order to obtain a position behind INDUSTRIALIST WAY.  He said he was not able to bring HOLMES LEGEND back behind that horse prior to SUPREME FRESH improving its position to be racing inside HOLMES LEGEND.  He said therefore he was obliged to let SUPREME FRESH to improve its position and he was able to obtain cover behind that horse after the 1200 Metres but was still left racing wide.

He said it was at this stage that other runners were improving into the race and not being able to improve at this time meant that SERGEANT TITANIUM was going to find it difficult then to finish off the race.  He added SERGEANT TITANIUM gave him a limited response when placed under pressure rounding the Home Turn, however, was disappointing in its failure to close off the race over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of SERGEANT TITANIUM immediately following the race found the horse to have sustained a small wound to the right front leg, however, an endoscopic examination was not able to be conducted due to it being fractious.
A veterinary inspection of AMBITIOUS CHAMPION immediately following the race revealed the horse to have sustained minor lacerations to both front legs.  Before being allowed to race again, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                The start was delayed when SUCCESSFUL LEADER proved difficult to lead up to the barriers.
LOYAL CRAFTSMAN began only fairly.
From wide barriers, HIGH SPEED METRO and TRIPLE KING were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, KEEN TACTICS and CASA JUNIOR raced tight between VITAL PRINCE and ENJOY THE GAME which was being ridden along in an attempt to obtain a forward position.  A short distance after this, ENJOY THE GAME, which continued to be ridden along, got its head up and lay in away from KEEN TACTICS, resulting in SUCCESSFUL LEADER momentarily racing in restricted room outside GLAMOROUS RYDER.
After the 1600 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of WINSOME SMILE.
Making the turn after the 900 Metres, KEEN TACTICS momentarily raced tight inside CASA JUNIOR which lay in.
Approaching the 800 Metres, SMART GUY was steadied when racing tight inside WINSOME SMILE.
Near the 650 Metres, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became unbalanced after being bumped by ENJOY THE GAME which shifted out when being ridden along.
Near the 100 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO was steadied and shifted in away from the heels of SMART GUY which shifted in under pressure.  TRIPLE KING, which was following, was inconvenienced in consequence.
Throughout the race, VITAL PRINCE travelled wide and without cover.
The performance of CASA JUNIOR, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CASA JUNIOR will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that as he had been instructed to lead on CHOICE EXCHEQUER, he rode his mount along in the early stages and was able to cross runners to his inside easily and obtain the lead shortly after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said on reaching the rail, he immediately commenced to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER.  He said whilst CHOICE EXCHEQUER had established a margin over the remainder of the field, the horse initially wanted to travel keenly, however, after entering the Back Straight he was able to settle it and dictate the terms of the race in sectionals which he believed would afford the horse the best opportunity to finish off the race.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER, N Callan stated that after parading to the Start with the lead pony, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became fractious and got away from the lead pony and then proved very difficult to lead up to the Start.  He said this resulted in him having to dismount SUCCESSFUL LEADER on a number of occasions as he felt that the horse may rear up if he had remained mounted.  He said after eventually being able to be led to the Start, SUCCESSFUL LEADER travelled satisfactorily in the early stages of the race, however, came off the bridle after the 900 Metres.  He added at its most recent start the horse also came off the bridle early in the race, however, stayed on well to the line, but today the horse did not close off as it did last start and was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SUCCESSFUL LEADER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER was considered unacceptable and that horse must barrier trial satisfactorily and be subjected to an official veterinary examination before its next race start and due to being difficult to lead up to the Start will be required to arrive at the barriers in that barrier trial in a timely manner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, Z Purton stated that the race did not suit HIGH SPEED METRO as it was run at a good tempo.  He said after the 900 Metres he had to niggle at HIGH SPEED METRO in order to improve its position which was in contrast to its most recent start when the horse travelled up into the race nicely.  He said he had to continually ride HIGH SPEED METRO along prior to the Home Turn and in the Straight, however, the horse did not finish off the race as it had at its most recent starts when ridden by him.  A veterinary inspection of HIGH SPEED METRO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, a winner of its most recent start, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HIGH SPEED METRO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
GLAMOROUS RYDER and SUPER STRIKE were sent for sampling.
<16/11/2015  Additional Veterinary Report>HIGH SPEED METRO, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer.  He said at that time there were no significant findings.  HIGH SPEED METRO was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer S Woods yesterday morning.  He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its right front leg.

                The start was delayed when SUCCESSFUL LEADER proved difficult to lead up to the barriers.
LOYAL CRAFTSMAN began only fairly.
From wide barriers, HIGH SPEED METRO and TRIPLE KING were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, KEEN TACTICS and CASA JUNIOR raced tight between VITAL PRINCE and ENJOY THE GAME which was being ridden along in an attempt to obtain a forward position.  A short distance after this, ENJOY THE GAME, which continued to be ridden along, got its head up and lay in away from KEEN TACTICS, resulting in SUCCESSFUL LEADER momentarily racing in restricted room outside GLAMOROUS RYDER.
After the 1600 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of WINSOME SMILE.
Making the turn after the 900 Metres, KEEN TACTICS momentarily raced tight inside CASA JUNIOR which lay in.
Approaching the 800 Metres, SMART GUY was steadied when racing tight inside WINSOME SMILE.
Near the 650 Metres, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became unbalanced after being bumped by ENJOY THE GAME which shifted out when being ridden along.
Near the 100 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO was steadied and shifted in away from the heels of SMART GUY which shifted in under pressure.  TRIPLE KING, which was following, was inconvenienced in consequence.
Throughout the race, VITAL PRINCE travelled wide and without cover.
The performance of CASA JUNIOR, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CASA JUNIOR will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that as he had been instructed to lead on CHOICE EXCHEQUER, he rode his mount along in the early stages and was able to cross runners to his inside easily and obtain the lead shortly after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said on reaching the rail, he immediately commenced to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER.  He said whilst CHOICE EXCHEQUER had established a margin over the remainder of the field, the horse initially wanted to travel keenly, however, after entering the Back Straight he was able to settle it and dictate the terms of the race in sectionals which he believed would afford the horse the best opportunity to finish off the race.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER, N Callan stated that after parading to the Start with the lead pony, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became fractious and got away from the lead pony and then proved very difficult to lead up to the Start.  He said this resulted in him having to dismount SUCCESSFUL LEADER on a number of occasions as he felt that the horse may rear up if he had remained mounted.  He said after eventually being able to be led to the Start, SUCCESSFUL LEADER travelled satisfactorily in the early stages of the race, however, came off the bridle after the 900 Metres.  He added at its most recent start the horse also came off the bridle early in the race, however, stayed on well to the line, but today the horse did not close off as it did last start and was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SUCCESSFUL LEADER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER was considered unacceptable and that horse must barrier trial satisfactorily and be subjected to an official veterinary examination before its next race start and due to being difficult to lead up to the Start will be required to arrive at the barriers in that barrier trial in a timely manner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, Z Purton stated that the race did not suit HIGH SPEED METRO as it was run at a good tempo.  He said after the 900 Metres he had to niggle at HIGH SPEED METRO in order to improve its position which was in contrast to its most recent start when the horse travelled up into the race nicely.  He said he had to continually ride HIGH SPEED METRO along prior to the Home Turn and in the Straight, however, the horse did not finish off the race as it had at its most recent starts when ridden by him.  A veterinary inspection of HIGH SPEED METRO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, a winner of its most recent start, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HIGH SPEED METRO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

<16/11/2015  Additional Veterinary Report>HIGH SPEED METRO, which performed poorly, was examined by the Veterinary Officer.  He said at that time there were no significant findings.  HIGH SPEED METRO was again examined by the Veterinary Officer at the stables of Trainer S Woods yesterday morning.  He said at this time he noted the horse to be lame in its right front leg.

                The start was delayed when SUCCESSFUL LEADER proved difficult to lead up to the barriers.
LOYAL CRAFTSMAN began only fairly.
From wide barriers, HIGH SPEED METRO and TRIPLE KING were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, KEEN TACTICS and CASA JUNIOR raced tight between VITAL PRINCE and ENJOY THE GAME which was being ridden along in an attempt to obtain a forward position.  A short distance after this, ENJOY THE GAME, which continued to be ridden along, got its head up and lay in away from KEEN TACTICS, resulting in SUCCESSFUL LEADER momentarily racing in restricted room outside GLAMOROUS RYDER.
After the 1600 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of WINSOME SMILE.
Making the turn after the 900 Metres, KEEN TACTICS momentarily raced tight inside CASA JUNIOR which lay in.
Approaching the 800 Metres, SMART GUY was steadied when racing tight inside WINSOME SMILE.
Near the 650 Metres, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became unbalanced after being bumped by ENJOY THE GAME which shifted out when being ridden along.
Near the 100 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO was steadied and shifted in away from the heels of SMART GUY which shifted in under pressure.  TRIPLE KING, which was following, was inconvenienced in consequence.
Throughout the race, VITAL PRINCE travelled wide and without cover.
The performance of CASA JUNIOR, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CASA JUNIOR will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that as he had been instructed to lead on CHOICE EXCHEQUER, he rode his mount along in the early stages and was able to cross runners to his inside easily and obtain the lead shortly after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said on reaching the rail, he immediately commenced to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER.  He said whilst CHOICE EXCHEQUER had established a margin over the remainder of the field, the horse initially wanted to travel keenly, however, after entering the Back Straight he was able to settle it and dictate the terms of the race in sectionals which he believed would afford the horse the best opportunity to finish off the race.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER, N Callan stated that after parading to the Start with the lead pony, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became fractious and got away from the lead pony and then proved very difficult to lead up to the Start.  He said this resulted in him having to dismount SUCCESSFUL LEADER on a number of occasions as he felt that the horse may rear up if he had remained mounted.  He said after eventually being able to be led to the Start, SUCCESSFUL LEADER travelled satisfactorily in the early stages of the race, however, came off the bridle after the 900 Metres.  He added at its most recent start the horse also came off the bridle early in the race, however, stayed on well to the line, but today the horse did not close off as it did last start and was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SUCCESSFUL LEADER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER was considered unacceptable and that horse must barrier trial satisfactorily and be subjected to an official veterinary examination before its next race start and due to being difficult to lead up to the Start will be required to arrive at the barriers in that barrier trial in a timely manner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, Z Purton stated that the race did not suit HIGH SPEED METRO as it was run at a good tempo.  He said after the 900 Metres he had to niggle at HIGH SPEED METRO in order to improve its position which was in contrast to its most recent start when the horse travelled up into the race nicely.  He said he had to continually ride HIGH SPEED METRO along prior to the Home Turn and in the Straight, however, the horse did not finish off the race as it had at its most recent starts when ridden by him.  A veterinary inspection of HIGH SPEED METRO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, a winner of its most recent start, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HIGH SPEED METRO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                The start was delayed when SUCCESSFUL LEADER proved difficult to lead up to the barriers.
LOYAL CRAFTSMAN began only fairly.
From wide barriers, HIGH SPEED METRO and TRIPLE KING were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, KEEN TACTICS and CASA JUNIOR raced tight between VITAL PRINCE and ENJOY THE GAME which was being ridden along in an attempt to obtain a forward position.  A short distance after this, ENJOY THE GAME, which continued to be ridden along, got its head up and lay in away from KEEN TACTICS, resulting in SUCCESSFUL LEADER momentarily racing in restricted room outside GLAMOROUS RYDER.
After the 1600 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO got its head up when awkwardly placed close to the heels of WINSOME SMILE.
Making the turn after the 900 Metres, KEEN TACTICS momentarily raced tight inside CASA JUNIOR which lay in.
Approaching the 800 Metres, SMART GUY was steadied when racing tight inside WINSOME SMILE.
Near the 650 Metres, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became unbalanced after being bumped by ENJOY THE GAME which shifted out when being ridden along.
Near the 100 Metres, HIGH SPEED METRO was steadied and shifted in away from the heels of SMART GUY which shifted in under pressure.  TRIPLE KING, which was following, was inconvenienced in consequence.
Throughout the race, VITAL PRINCE travelled wide and without cover.
The performance of CASA JUNIOR, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, CASA JUNIOR will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned, N Rawiller stated that as he had been instructed to lead on CHOICE EXCHEQUER, he rode his mount along in the early stages and was able to cross runners to his inside easily and obtain the lead shortly after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said on reaching the rail, he immediately commenced to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER.  He said whilst CHOICE EXCHEQUER had established a margin over the remainder of the field, the horse initially wanted to travel keenly, however, after entering the Back Straight he was able to settle it and dictate the terms of the race in sectionals which he believed would afford the horse the best opportunity to finish off the race.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER, N Callan stated that after parading to the Start with the lead pony, SUCCESSFUL LEADER became fractious and got away from the lead pony and then proved very difficult to lead up to the Start.  He said this resulted in him having to dismount SUCCESSFUL LEADER on a number of occasions as he felt that the horse may rear up if he had remained mounted.  He said after eventually being able to be led to the Start, SUCCESSFUL LEADER travelled satisfactorily in the early stages of the race, however, came off the bridle after the 900 Metres.  He added at its most recent start the horse also came off the bridle early in the race, however, stayed on well to the line, but today the horse did not close off as it did last start and was disappointing in its failure to respond to his riding.  A veterinary inspection of SUCCESSFUL LEADER immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of SUCCESSFUL LEADER was considered unacceptable and that horse must barrier trial satisfactorily and be subjected to an official veterinary examination before its next race start and due to being difficult to lead up to the Start will be required to arrive at the barriers in that barrier trial in a timely manner.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, Z Purton stated that the race did not suit HIGH SPEED METRO as it was run at a good tempo.  He said after the 900 Metres he had to niggle at HIGH SPEED METRO in order to improve its position which was in contrast to its most recent start when the horse travelled up into the race nicely.  He said he had to continually ride HIGH SPEED METRO along prior to the Home Turn and in the Straight, however, the horse did not finish off the race as it had at its most recent starts when ridden by him.  A veterinary inspection of HIGH SPEED METRO immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of HIGH SPEED METRO, a winner of its most recent start, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HIGH SPEED METRO will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Shortly after the start, LUCKY OMENS was crowded for room between CALIFORNIA DISEGNO and VICTORY MAGIC which shifted out.
After being crossed by SERGEANT TITANIUM near the 1700 Metres, REGENCY KING got its head up on a number of occasions when proving very difficult to settle.

At the entrance to the Straight, VICTORY MAGIC raced tight between ALLCASH and GOODHEART SUCCESS which shifted out.  In this incident, both VICTORY MAGIC and GOODHEART SUCCESS became unbalanced after bumping.
Passing the 300 Metres, ANTICIPATION was held up for clear running behind SAVVY NATURE.  ANTICIPATION then had some difficulty obtaining clear running until near the 200 Metres.
For the majority of the race, CALIFORNIA DISEGNO travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, N Callan (DOYENI) stated that after beginning only fairly, he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion he continued to ride his mount along to cross ANTICIPATION to his inside, however, near the 1700 Metres DOYENI commenced to hang out and then near the 1600 Metres shifted out abruptly, therefore he had to apply considerable pressure to the right rein in order to shift DOYENI back over towards the rail.  He said it was not until entering the Back Straight that DOYENI commenced to race more tractably but even then was still inclined to race with its head on the side.  He added he tried to allow the horse to set a more genuine pace in front as DOYENI had responded well at its last start when racing behind a good tempo.  He said however that DOYENI was reluctant to stride along and it was not until SAVVY NATURE improved its position around DOYENI after the 1200 Metres that his mount commenced to race more genuinely.  He said when SAVVY NATURE went forward of DOYENI, he did consider allowing that horse to cross DOYENI into the lead given that DOYENI had raced well at its last start when ridden in this manner, however, he feared that SAVVY NATURE would then not continue into the lead at a genuine tempo and he did not want to get caught behind that horse were other horses to have improved around SAVVY NATURE.  He said therefore after the 1100 Metres he rode his mount along in order to consolidate its position inside SAVVY NATURE.  He added in the Straight DOYENI finished off the race only one-paced.  A veterinary inspection of DOYENI immediately following the race revealed the horse to be lame in its left front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, DOYENI will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

After being crossed by SERGEANT TITANIUM near the 1700 Metres, REGENCY KING got its head up on a number of occasions when proving very difficult to settle.

For the majority of the race, CALIFORNIA DISEGNO travelled wide and without cover.
When questioned, N Callan (DOYENI) stated that after beginning only fairly, he rode his mount along in the early stages to take up a forward position.  He said passing the winning post on the first occasion he continued to ride his mount along to cross ANTICIPATION to his inside, however, near the 1700 Metres DOYENI commenced to hang out and then near the 1600 Metres shifted out abruptly, therefore he had to apply considerable pressure to the right rein in order to shift DOYENI back over towards the rail.  He said it was not until entering the Back Straight that DOYENI commenced to race more tractably but even then was still inclined to race with its head on the side.  He added he tried to allow the horse to set a more genuine pace in front as DOYENI had responded well at its last start when racing behind a good tempo.  He said however that DOYENI was reluctant to stride along and it was not until SAVVY NATURE improved its position around DOYENI after the 1200 Metres that his mount commenced to race more genuinely.  He said when SAVVY NATURE went forward of DOYENI, he did consider allowing that horse to cross DOYENI into the lead given that DOYENI had raced well at its last start when ridden in this manner, however, he feared that SAVVY NATURE would then not continue into the lead at a genuine tempo and he did not want to get caught behind that horse were other horses to have improved around SAVVY NATURE.  He said therefore after the 1100 Metres he rode his mount along in order to consolidate its position inside SAVVY NATURE.  He added in the Straight DOYENI finished off the race only one-paced.  A veterinary inspection of DOYENI immediately following the race revealed the horse to be lame in its left front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, DOYENI will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and MIDNITE PROMISE raced tight as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out into clear running.  TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was then held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight.
Passing the 200 Metres, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and EAGLE POWER were crowded for room between UNIQUE HAPPIEST which was taken out by HAPPILABABY and MIDNITE PROMISE which, when giving ground, got its head on the side and shifted in away from HAPPY ROCKY.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, C Schofield stated that in accordance with his instructions he obtained a forward position on the horse.  He said the tempo of the race in the early and middle stags was quicker than he anticipated, nonetheless MIDNITE PROMISE continued to travel satisfactorily and he was able to obtain a position with cover behind EAGLE POWER when that horse improved around MIDNITE PROMISE after the 1200 Metres.  He said MIDNITE PROMISE came under pressure after the 600 Metres and after becoming unbalanced when bumped by TRIUMPHANT DRAGON rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, MIDNITE PROMISE then gave ground and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of MIDNITE PROMISE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, a favourite for this race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MIDNITE PROMISE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
The Stewards questioned K Teetan regarding his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after the 600 Metres.  K Teetan stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 2, to take a trailing position behind the anticipated leader of the race UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said after being able to obtain this position, ALLCASH then travelled well during the race.  He said prior to the 500 Metres he was racing behind TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and slightly away from the running rail.  He said when TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out passing the 500 Metres, he looked to his inside to ensure that no runner had improved to his inside and after doing so he shifted ALLCASH back towards the rail.  He said rounding the Home turn and at the entrance to the Straight he was aware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST was racing near the rail and he noted that EAGLE POWER, which was racing to the outside of that horse, had come under heavy pressure.  He said as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was attempting to shift MIDNITE PROMISE out at this stage, he felt the most likely avenue to improve was advancing to the outside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST when EAGLE POWER commenced to give ground.  He said therefore he shifted ALLCASH out with TRIUMPHANT DRAGON in order to improve into the run when EAGLE POWER gave ground.  He said as he was doing this he was initially unaware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST had shifted away from the rail which had created a tight run to the inside of that horse.  He added passing the 400 Metres he looked to his inside to ascertain whether it was available for him to shift ALLCASH to the inside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST to take advantage of that run, however, at this time he received a loud call from Z Purton, the rider of HAPPILABABY, and as he could see that horse improving to his inside, he did not believe that it was available to him to shift ALLCASH in as he was concerned that he would have caused interference to that horse and therefore, on safety grounds, he remained racing one horse off the rail behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said HAPPILABABY then advanced quickly to the inside of ALLCASH and he had another look to his inside near the 350 Metres to ascertain how quickly HAPPILABABY was improving its position so that he could shift across behind that horse and follow it through inside UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  Mr A T Millard, the trainer of ALLCASH, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Teetan.  He said after the race he questioned K Teetan regarding him not shifting in from behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST after the 400 Metres as he believed that it may have been available for Jockey Teetan to have done so at this time.  After viewing the video of the race, Mr Millard confirmed that it was available for Jockey Teetan to shift ALLCASH in at that time and stated that, in his opinion, Jockey Teetan had erred in failing to immediately shift ALLCASH in after the 400 Metres prior to HAPPILABABY improving to the inside of ALLCASH.  After viewing the video, K Teetan conceded that he had made an error of judgement by not shifting in after the 400 Metres, however, he reiterated that during the race he believed that HAPPILABABY was in a position to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH.  After considering the evidence and the circumstances of his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after entering the Straight, the Stewards advised Jockey Teetan that they had considered issuing a charge against him for breaching a significant Rule of Racing, however, in the circumstances, having regard to the manner in which HAPPILABABY improved quickly to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH, the Stewards believed that it was not appropriate for him to be charged over this aspect of his riding.  Nonetheless he was severely reprimanded and advised that he must ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner as to be able to improve their position as runs become available so that there can be no doubts as to his intentions to win or to obtain the best possible placing.  A veterinary inspection of ALLCASH immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

He said the tempo of the race in the early and middle stags was quicker than he anticipated, nonetheless MIDNITE PROMISE continued to travel satisfactorily and he was able to obtain a position with cover behind EAGLE POWER when that horse improved around MIDNITE PROMISE after the 1200 Metres.  He said MIDNITE PROMISE came under pressure after the 600 Metres and after becoming unbalanced when bumped by TRIUMPHANT DRAGON rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, MIDNITE PROMISE then gave ground and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of MIDNITE PROMISE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, a favourite for this race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MIDNITE PROMISE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
The Stewards questioned K Teetan regarding his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after the 600 Metres.  K Teetan stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 2, to take a trailing position behind the anticipated leader of the race UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said after being able to obtain this position, ALLCASH then travelled well during the race.  He said prior to the 500 Metres he was racing behind TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and slightly away from the running rail.  He said when TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out passing the 500 Metres, he looked to his inside to ensure that no runner had improved to his inside and after doing so he shifted ALLCASH back towards the rail.  He said rounding the Home turn and at the entrance to the Straight he was aware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST was racing near the rail and he noted that EAGLE POWER, which was racing to the outside of that horse, had come under heavy pressure.  He said as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was attempting to shift MIDNITE PROMISE out at this stage, he felt the most likely avenue to improve was advancing to the outside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST when EAGLE POWER commenced to give ground.  He said therefore he shifted ALLCASH out with TRIUMPHANT DRAGON in order to improve into the run when EAGLE POWER gave ground.  He said as he was doing this he was initially unaware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST had shifted away from the rail which had created a tight run to the inside of that horse.  He added passing the 400 Metres he looked to his inside to ascertain whether it was available for him to shift ALLCASH to the inside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST to take advantage of that run, however, at this time he received a loud call from Z Purton, the rider of HAPPILABABY, and as he could see that horse improving to his inside, he did not believe that it was available to him to shift ALLCASH in as he was concerned that he would have caused interference to that horse and therefore, on safety grounds, he remained racing one horse off the rail behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said HAPPILABABY then advanced quickly to the inside of ALLCASH and he had another look to his inside near the 350 Metres to ascertain how quickly HAPPILABABY was improving its position so that he could shift across behind that horse and follow it through inside UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  Mr A T Millard, the trainer of ALLCASH, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Teetan.  He said after the race he questioned K Teetan regarding him not shifting in from behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST after the 400 Metres as he believed that it may have been available for Jockey Teetan to have done so at this time.  After viewing the video of the race, Mr Millard confirmed that it was available for Jockey Teetan to shift ALLCASH in at that time and stated that, in his opinion, Jockey Teetan had erred in failing to immediately shift ALLCASH in after the 400 Metres prior to HAPPILABABY improving to the inside of ALLCASH.  After viewing the video, K Teetan conceded that he had made an error of judgement by not shifting in after the 400 Metres, however, he reiterated that during the race he believed that HAPPILABABY was in a position to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH.  After considering the evidence and the circumstances of his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after entering the Straight, the Stewards advised Jockey Teetan that they had considered issuing a charge against him for breaching a significant Rule of Racing, however, in the circumstances, having regard to the manner in which HAPPILABABY improved quickly to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH, the Stewards believed that it was not appropriate for him to be charged over this aspect of his riding.  Nonetheless he was severely reprimanded and advised that he must ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner as to be able to improve their position as runs become available so that there can be no doubts as to his intentions to win or to obtain the best possible placing.  A veterinary inspection of ALLCASH immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

After viewing the video of the race, Mr Millard confirmed that it was available for Jockey Teetan to shift ALLCASH in at that time and stated that, in his opinion, Jockey Teetan had erred in failing to immediately shift ALLCASH in after the 400 Metres prior to HAPPILABABY improving to the inside of ALLCASH.  After viewing the video, K Teetan conceded that he had made an error of judgement by not shifting in after the 400 Metres, however, he reiterated that during the race he believed that HAPPILABABY was in a position to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH.  After considering the evidence and the circumstances of his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after entering the Straight, the Stewards advised Jockey Teetan that they had considered issuing a charge against him for breaching a significant Rule of Racing, however, in the circumstances, having regard to the manner in which HAPPILABABY improved quickly to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH, the Stewards believed that it was not appropriate for him to be charged over this aspect of his riding.  Nonetheless he was severely reprimanded and advised that he must ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner as to be able to improve their position as runs become available so that there can be no doubts as to his intentions to win or to obtain the best possible placing.  A veterinary inspection of ALLCASH immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

From wide barriers, FULL GLORY, ADMIRAL LORD and ASHKIYR were shifted across behind runners in the early stages.
After passing the winning post on the first occasion, HAPPY ROCKY momentarily raced tight inside JOLLY GENE which got its head on the side and shifted in away from TRIUMPHANT DRAGON.
After the 1700 Metres, EAGLE POWER was left racing wide and without cover and after the 1200 Metres was allowed to stride forward to race outside the lead.
After the 1000 Metres, LUCKY OMENS was left racing wide and without cover.
After the 800 Metres, ADMIRAL LORD was eased down.  A veterinary inspection of ADMIRAL LORD immediately following the race revealed that the horse was displaying an irregular heart rhythm.

Rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and MIDNITE PROMISE raced tight as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out into clear running.  TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was then held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight.
Passing the 200 Metres, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and EAGLE POWER were crowded for room between UNIQUE HAPPIEST which was taken out by HAPPILABABY and MIDNITE PROMISE which, when giving ground, got its head on the side and shifted in away from HAPPY ROCKY.

When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, C Schofield stated that in accordance with his instructions he obtained a forward position on the horse.  He said the tempo of the race in the early and middle stags was quicker than he anticipated, nonetheless MIDNITE PROMISE continued to travel satisfactorily and he was able to obtain a position with cover behind EAGLE POWER when that horse improved around MIDNITE PROMISE after the 1200 Metres.  He said MIDNITE PROMISE came under pressure after the 600 Metres and after becoming unbalanced when bumped by TRIUMPHANT DRAGON rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, MIDNITE PROMISE then gave ground and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of MIDNITE PROMISE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, a favourite for this race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MIDNITE PROMISE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
The Stewards questioned K Teetan regarding his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after the 600 Metres.  K Teetan stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 2, to take a trailing position behind the anticipated leader of the race UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said after being able to obtain this position, ALLCASH then travelled well during the race.  He said prior to the 500 Metres he was racing behind TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and slightly away from the running rail.  He said when TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out passing the 500 Metres, he looked to his inside to ensure that no runner had improved to his inside and after doing so he shifted ALLCASH back towards the rail.  He said rounding the Home turn and at the entrance to the Straight he was aware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST was racing near the rail and he noted that EAGLE POWER, which was racing to the outside of that horse, had come under heavy pressure.  He said as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was attempting to shift MIDNITE PROMISE out at this stage, he felt the most likely avenue to improve was advancing to the outside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST when EAGLE POWER commenced to give ground.  He said therefore he shifted ALLCASH out with TRIUMPHANT DRAGON in order to improve into the run when EAGLE POWER gave ground.  He said as he was doing this he was initially unaware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST had shifted away from the rail which had created a tight run to the inside of that horse.  He added passing the 400 Metres he looked to his inside to ascertain whether it was available for him to shift ALLCASH to the inside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST to take advantage of that run, however, at this time he received a loud call from Z Purton, the rider of HAPPILABABY, and as he could see that horse improving to his inside, he did not believe that it was available to him to shift ALLCASH in as he was concerned that he would have caused interference to that horse and therefore, on safety grounds, he remained racing one horse off the rail behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said HAPPILABABY then advanced quickly to the inside of ALLCASH and he had another look to his inside near the 350 Metres to ascertain how quickly HAPPILABABY was improving its position so that he could shift across behind that horse and follow it through inside UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  Mr A T Millard, the trainer of ALLCASH, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Teetan.

Rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and MIDNITE PROMISE raced tight as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out into clear running.  TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was then held up for clear running in the early part of the Straight.
Passing the 200 Metres, TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and EAGLE POWER were crowded for room between UNIQUE HAPPIEST which was taken out by HAPPILABABY and MIDNITE PROMISE which, when giving ground, got its head on the side and shifted in away from HAPPY ROCKY.
FULL GLORY was badly held up for clear running from near the 300 Metres until approaching the 100 Metres.
CHINA DELIGHT was held up for clear running from prior to the 200 Metres until after the 100 Metres.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, C Schofield stated that in accordance with his instructions he obtained a forward position on the horse.  He said the tempo of the race in the early and middle stags was quicker than he anticipated, nonetheless MIDNITE PROMISE continued to travel satisfactorily and he was able to obtain a position with cover behind EAGLE POWER when that horse improved around MIDNITE PROMISE after the 1200 Metres.  He said MIDNITE PROMISE came under pressure after the 600 Metres and after becoming unbalanced when bumped by TRIUMPHANT DRAGON rounding the Home Turn and in the early part of the Straight, MIDNITE PROMISE then gave ground and was disappointing.  A veterinary inspection of MIDNITE PROMISE immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MIDNITE PROMISE, a favourite for this race, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MIDNITE PROMISE will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
The Stewards questioned K Teetan regarding his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after the 600 Metres.  K Teetan stated that he had been instructed, from barrier 2, to take a trailing position behind the anticipated leader of the race UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said after being able to obtain this position, ALLCASH then travelled well during the race.  He said prior to the 500 Metres he was racing behind TRIUMPHANT DRAGON and slightly away from the running rail.  He said when TRIUMPHANT DRAGON attempted to shift out passing the 500 Metres, he looked to his inside to ensure that no runner had improved to his inside and after doing so he shifted ALLCASH back towards the rail.  He said rounding the Home turn and at the entrance to the Straight he was aware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST was racing near the rail and he noted that EAGLE POWER, which was racing to the outside of that horse, had come under heavy pressure.  He said as TRIUMPHANT DRAGON was attempting to shift MIDNITE PROMISE out at this stage, he felt the most likely avenue to improve was advancing to the outside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST when EAGLE POWER commenced to give ground.  He said therefore he shifted ALLCASH out with TRIUMPHANT DRAGON in order to improve into the run when EAGLE POWER gave ground.  He said as he was doing this he was initially unaware that UNIQUE HAPPIEST had shifted away from the rail which had created a tight run to the inside of that horse.  He added passing the 400 Metres he looked to his inside to ascertain whether it was available for him to shift ALLCASH to the inside of UNIQUE HAPPIEST to take advantage of that run, however, at this time he received a loud call from Z Purton, the rider of HAPPILABABY, and as he could see that horse improving to his inside, he did not believe that it was available to him to shift ALLCASH in as he was concerned that he would have caused interference to that horse and therefore, on safety grounds, he remained racing one horse off the rail behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  He said HAPPILABABY then advanced quickly to the inside of ALLCASH and he had another look to his inside near the 350 Metres to ascertain how quickly HAPPILABABY was improving its position so that he could shift across behind that horse and follow it through inside UNIQUE HAPPIEST.  Mr A T Millard, the trainer of ALLCASH, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Teetan.  He said after the race he questioned K Teetan regarding him not shifting in from behind UNIQUE HAPPIEST after the 400 Metres as he believed that it may have been available for Jockey Teetan to have done so at this time.  After viewing the video of the race, Mr Millard confirmed that it was available for Jockey Teetan to shift ALLCASH in at that time and stated that, in his opinion, Jockey Teetan had erred in failing to immediately shift ALLCASH in after the 400 Metres prior to HAPPILABABY improving to the inside of ALLCASH.  After viewing the video, K Teetan conceded that he had made an error of judgement by not shifting in after the 400 Metres, however, he reiterated that during the race he believed that HAPPILABABY was in a position to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH.  After considering the evidence and the circumstances of his riding of ALLCASH, particularly after entering the Straight, the Stewards advised Jockey Teetan that they had considered issuing a charge against him for breaching a significant Rule of Racing, however, in the circumstances, having regard to the manner in which HAPPILABABY improved quickly to be racing inside the heels of ALLCASH, the Stewards believed that it was not appropriate for him to be charged over this aspect of his riding.  Nonetheless he was severely reprimanded and advised that he must ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner as to be able to improve their position as runs become available so that there can be no doubts as to his intentions to win or to obtain the best possible placing.  A veterinary inspection of ALLCASH immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

From the outside barrier, FLYING MACHINE got its head up on jumping when being steadied in order to be shifted across behind runners.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN and FANTASTICLIFE raced tight.
G Lerena (FANTASTICLIFE) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 1700 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of SWEET BEAN, causing that horse to be taken in across the rightful running of FLYING MACHINE, causing that horse to be checked and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  G Lerena was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 23 June 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 15 June 2016.  In addition, G Lerena was fined $5,000.
After the 1400 Metres, WIN CHANCE was left racing wide and without cover and was consequently allowed to improve its position into the lead.

Near the 150 Metres, SWEET BEAN was shifted to the inside of GOOD FIT after being disappointed for running outside that horse which shifted out to improve.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MALAYAN PEARL, Z Purton stated that in the early stages he was able to take up a forward position on the horse, however, he did have to ride it along to do so.  He said MALAYAN PEARL did not travel well at any stage of the race and he had to ride the horse along after the 1200 Metres in order to maintain its position.  He said he then had to continually ride MALAYAN PEARL along including slapping the horse down the shoulder with the whip on occasions as it was reluctant to hold its position.  He said he continued to ride the horse along after this and passing the 600 Metres was required to ride it with some urgency as MALAYAN PEARL was commencing to give ground.  He said, despite being ridden along, MALAYAN PEARL was unable to maintain its position which allowed THIS IS GLADIATOR to improve inside MALAYAN PEARL.  He added as MALAYAN PEARL was racing like a horse that may be experiencing some internal issues, he eased it down in the Straight.  Mr D Cruz, the trainer of MALAYAN PEARL, stated that he was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of the horse as it had done particularly well since its last start success.  He said he had ridden MALAYAN PEARL on numerous occasions in the lead up to today's race including its final piece of fast work and had pleased him in the manner in which it completed its work.  He said the only possible explanation for the horse's run today was that the race was run at a fast tempo in the middle stages and this may have forced MALAYAN PEARL, which was racing up on the speed, off the bridle sooner than it may ordinarily have been.  He added, irrespective of this, MALAYAN PEARL was very disappointing in that it did not appear to travel well at any stage of the race.  A veterinary inspection of MALAYAN PEARL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MALAYAN PEARL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MALAYAN PEARL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, N Callan stated that as there did not appear to be much pace engaged in the race, he rode his mount along in the early stages from an inside barrier to obtain a midfield position.  He said LOYAL CRAFTSMAN travelled well until WIN CHANCE improved its position after the 1200 Metres at which time his mount came off the bridle.  He said because of this he had to ride LOYAL CRAFTSMAN along, however, the horse was reluctant to maintain its position.  He added he again had to ride LOYAL CRAFTSMAN aggressively after the 700 Metres to prevent SWEET BEAN from shifting out to his inside and then after that had to continue to ride the horse along as LOYAL CRAFTSMAN was not improving its position at that time.  He said he shifted LOYAL CRAFTSMAN to the outside in the Straight and, after staying on fairly in the early part of the Straight, was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened over the concluding stages.

The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 15 June 2016.  In addition, G Lerena was fined $5,000.
After the 1400 Metres, WIN CHANCE was left racing wide and without cover and was consequently allowed to improve its position into the lead.

Near the 150 Metres, SWEET BEAN was shifted to the inside of GOOD FIT after being disappointed for running outside that horse which shifted out to improve.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MALAYAN PEARL, Z Purton stated that in the early stages he was able to take up a forward position on the horse, however, he did have to ride it along to do so.  He said MALAYAN PEARL did not travel well at any stage of the race and he had to ride the horse along after the 1200 Metres in order to maintain its position.  He said he then had to continually ride MALAYAN PEARL along including slapping the horse down the shoulder with the whip on occasions as it was reluctant to hold its position.  He said he continued to ride the horse along after this and passing the 600 Metres was required to ride it with some urgency as MALAYAN PEARL was commencing to give ground.  He said, despite being ridden along, MALAYAN PEARL was unable to maintain its position which allowed THIS IS GLADIATOR to improve inside MALAYAN PEARL.  He added as MALAYAN PEARL was racing like a horse that may be experiencing some internal issues, he eased it down in the Straight.  Mr D Cruz, the trainer of MALAYAN PEARL, stated that he was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of the horse as it had done particularly well since its last start success.  He said he had ridden MALAYAN PEARL on numerous occasions in the lead up to today's race including its final piece of fast work and had pleased him in the manner in which it completed its work.  He said the only possible explanation for the horse's run today was that the race was run at a fast tempo in the middle stages and this may have forced MALAYAN PEARL, which was racing up on the speed, off the bridle sooner than it may ordinarily have been.  He added, irrespective of this, MALAYAN PEARL was very disappointing in that it did not appear to travel well at any stage of the race.  A veterinary inspection of MALAYAN PEARL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MALAYAN PEARL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MALAYAN PEARL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, N Callan stated that as there did not appear to be much pace engaged in the race, he rode his mount along in the early stages from an inside barrier to obtain a midfield position.  He said LOYAL CRAFTSMAN travelled well until WIN CHANCE improved its position after the 1200 Metres at which time his mount came off the bridle.  He said because of this he had to ride LOYAL CRAFTSMAN along, however, the horse was reluctant to maintain its position.  He added he again had to ride LOYAL CRAFTSMAN aggressively after the 700 Metres to prevent SWEET BEAN from shifting out to his inside and then after that had to continue to ride the horse along as LOYAL CRAFTSMAN was not improving its position at that time.  He said he shifted LOYAL CRAFTSMAN to the outside in the Straight and, after staying on fairly in the early part of the Straight, was disappointing in the manner in which it weakened over the concluding stages.  A veterinary inspection of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.

G Lerena (FANTASTICLIFE) was found guilty of a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that near the 1700 Metres he permitted his mount to shift in when not clear of SWEET BEAN, causing that horse to be taken in across the rightful running of FLYING MACHINE, causing that horse to be checked and to lose the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  G Lerena was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 23 June 2016 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  The commencement of the suspension was deferred until after the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 15 June 2016.  In addition, G Lerena was fined $5,000.
After the 1400 Metres, WIN CHANCE was left racing wide and without cover and was consequently allowed to improve its position into the lead.

Near the 150 Metres, SWEET BEAN was shifted to the inside of GOOD FIT after being disappointed for running outside that horse which shifted out to improve.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of MALAYAN PEARL, Z Purton stated that in the early stages he was able to take up a forward position on the horse, however, he did have to ride it along to do so.  He said MALAYAN PEARL did not travel well at any stage of the race and he had to ride the horse along after the 1200 Metres in order to maintain its position.  He said he then had to continually ride MALAYAN PEARL along including slapping the horse down the shoulder with the whip on occasions as it was reluctant to hold its position.  He said he continued to ride the horse along after this and passing the 600 Metres was required to ride it with some urgency as MALAYAN PEARL was commencing to give ground.  He said, despite being ridden along, MALAYAN PEARL was unable to maintain its position which allowed THIS IS GLADIATOR to improve inside MALAYAN PEARL.  He added as MALAYAN PEARL was racing like a horse that may be experiencing some internal issues, he eased it down in the Straight.  Mr D Cruz, the trainer of MALAYAN PEARL, stated that he was unable to offer any explanation for the disappointing performance of the horse as it had done particularly well since its last start success.  He said he had ridden MALAYAN PEARL on numerous occasions in the lead up to today's race including its final piece of fast work and had pleased him in the manner in which it completed its work.  He said the only possible explanation for the horse's run today was that the race was run at a fast tempo in the middle stages and this may have forced MALAYAN PEARL, which was racing up on the speed, off the bridle sooner than it may ordinarily have been.  He added, irrespective of this, MALAYAN PEARL was very disappointing in that it did not appear to travel well at any stage of the race.  A veterinary inspection of MALAYAN PEARL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of MALAYAN PEARL, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, MALAYAN PEARL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN, N Callan stated that as there did not appear to be much pace engaged in the race, he rode his mount along in the early stages from an inside barrier to obtain a midfield position.

When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he was asked not to rush LUCKY GIRL early but to allow the horse to stride forward gradually in the early stages to obtain a prominent position.  He said in the early stages LUCKY GIRL was able to improve without having to be ridden along and after entering the Back Straight was able to obtain a position outside MCQUEEN which raced behind the leader SUPREME PROFIT.  He said LUCKY GIRL travelled strongly in the middle stages and he expected the horse to finish off the race well, however, LUCKY GIRL came under pressure after the 600 Metres and, despite being ridden along, did not quicken at any time and in the Straight gave ground.  He added he could not detect any abnormalities with the action of LUCKY GIRL which may have explained the horseâs disappointing run.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of LUCKY GIRL, said as the horse had done particularly well since its last start, he expected it to run well.  He said after M L Yeung rode LUCKY GIRL in a gallop in the lead up to todayâs race, both he and Jockey Yeung considered the horse to be a strong chance as it had worked particularly well.  He said although up in grade today, he did feel that LUCKY GIRL would benefit from having a light weight, so he was not concerned with the step up in class.  He added he was disappointed with the manner in which LUCKY GIRL finished off the race, particularly given the way the horse weakened over the final 200 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of LUCKY GIRL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of LUCKY GIRL was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LUCKY GIRL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Apprentice K K Chiong (SUPREME PROFIT) was spoken to regarding the tempo of the race between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres after obtaining the lead.  Apprentice Chiong was told to be mindful of the tempo she sets so as to ensure that horses are able to finish off their race.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he was asked not to rush LUCKY GIRL early but to allow the horse to stride forward gradually in the early stages to obtain a prominent position.  He said in the early stages LUCKY GIRL was able to improve without having to be ridden along and after entering the Back Straight was able to obtain a position outside MCQUEEN which raced behind the leader SUPREME PROFIT.  He said LUCKY GIRL travelled strongly in the middle stages and he expected the horse to finish off the race well, however, LUCKY GIRL came under pressure after the 600 Metres and, despite being ridden along, did not quicken at any time and in the Straight gave ground.  He added he could not detect any abnormalities with the action of LUCKY GIRL which may have explained the horseâs disappointing run.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of LUCKY GIRL, said as the horse had done particularly well since its last start, he expected it to run well.  He said after M L Yeung rode LUCKY GIRL in a gallop in the lead up to todayâs race, both he and Jockey Yeung considered the horse to be a strong chance as it had worked particularly well.  He said although up in grade today, he did feel that LUCKY GIRL would benefit from having a light weight, so he was not concerned with the step up in class.  He added he was disappointed with the manner in which LUCKY GIRL finished off the race, particularly given the way the horse weakened over the final 200 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of LUCKY GIRL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of LUCKY GIRL was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LUCKY GIRL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

ENSURING was crowded for room on jumping between ISHVARA which shifted in after being bumped by BASIC TRILOGY and MCQUEEN which shifted out.
AMBITIOUS CHAMPION began only fairly and shortly after the start was checked when crowded for room between LITTLE DRAGON which shifted out after being bumped by STAR MAJESTIC and HARBOUR MASTER which was taken in by HAPPILABABY after those two horses bumped on jumping.
Shortly after the start, BASIC TRILOGY got its head up when being steadied to obtain cover and approaching the winning post on the first occasion became unbalanced after being bumped by ISHVARA which shifted out.
After passing the winning post on the first occasion, HEROIC GURU momentarily raced in restricted room inside RENAISSANCE ART which was taken in by MCQUEEN.
After the 1700 Metres, SUPREME PROFIT was shifted away from the heels of LUCKY GIRL and taken wider by that horse which was taken out by ISHVARA.
Approaching the 1600 Metres, MCQUEEN got its head up when being steadied in the lead.
After the 1200 Metres, LITTLE DRAGON was left racing wide and without cover.
Approaching the 1100 Metres, HAPPILABABY was bumped by BASIC TRILOGY which shifted out away from the heels of STAR MAJESTIC when proving difficult to settle.
Approaching the 600 Metres, AMBITIOUS CHAMPION was taken wider by BASIC TRILOGY which shifted out.
Passing the 500 Metres, BASIC TRILOGY was inconvenienced when disappointed for running between STAR MAJESTIC and RENAISSANCE ART which, when shifting to the outside of ISHVARA, was awkwardly placed close to the heels of that horse.  In this incident, RENAISSANCE ART bumped the hindquarters of STAR MAJESTIC which became unbalanced.
ENSURING had difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight.
HARBOUR MASTER was held up for clear running passing the 250 Metres.
In the Straight, HAPPILABABY hung in and proved difficult to ride and near the 100 Metres shifted in and bumped MCQUEEN.  ENSURING, which was following, was shifted in away from the heels of MCQUEEN in consequence, resulting in HARBOUR MASTER being awkwardly placed over the concluding stages.
After the 100 Metres, ANTICIPATION was momentarily steadied when disappointed for running between RENAISSANCE ART and HAPPILABABY.  Then close to the finishing line, ANTICIPATION was held up for clear running behind RENAISSANCE ART and consequently was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
Near the 50 Metres, MCQUEEN was awkwardly placed inside the heels of HAPPILABABY which shifted in after being bumped by RENAISSANCE ART.
Apprentice K K Chiong (SUPREME PROFIT) was spoken to regarding the tempo of the race between the 1200 Metres and the 800 Metres after obtaining the lead.  Apprentice Chiong was told to be mindful of the tempo she sets so as to ensure that horses are able to finish off their race.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he was asked not to rush LUCKY GIRL early but to allow the horse to stride forward gradually in the early stages to obtain a prominent position.  He said in the early stages LUCKY GIRL was able to improve without having to be ridden along and after entering the Back Straight was able to obtain a position outside MCQUEEN which raced behind the leader SUPREME PROFIT.  He said LUCKY GIRL travelled strongly in the middle stages and he expected the horse to finish off the race well, however, LUCKY GIRL came under pressure after the 600 Metres and, despite being ridden along, did not quicken at any time and in the Straight gave ground.  He added he could not detect any abnormalities with the action of LUCKY GIRL which may have explained the horseâs disappointing run.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of LUCKY GIRL, said as the horse had done particularly well since its last start, he expected it to run well.  He said after M L Yeung rode LUCKY GIRL in a gallop in the lead up to todayâs race, both he and Jockey Yeung considered the horse to be a strong chance as it had worked particularly well.  He said although up in grade today, he did feel that LUCKY GIRL would benefit from having a light weight, so he was not concerned with the step up in class.  He added he was disappointed with the manner in which LUCKY GIRL finished off the race, particularly given the way the horse weakened over the final 200 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of LUCKY GIRL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of LUCKY GIRL was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LUCKY GIRL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned, M L Yeung stated that he was asked not to rush LUCKY GIRL early but to allow the horse to stride forward gradually in the early stages to obtain a prominent position.  He said in the early stages LUCKY GIRL was able to improve without having to be ridden along and after entering the Back Straight was able to obtain a position outside MCQUEEN which raced behind the leader SUPREME PROFIT.  He said LUCKY GIRL travelled strongly in the middle stages and he expected the horse to finish off the race well, however, LUCKY GIRL came under pressure after the 600 Metres and, despite being ridden along, did not quicken at any time and in the Straight gave ground.  He added he could not detect any abnormalities with the action of LUCKY GIRL which may have explained the horseâs disappointing run.  Mr C H Yip, the trainer of LUCKY GIRL, said as the horse had done particularly well since its last start, he expected it to run well.  He said after M L Yeung rode LUCKY GIRL in a gallop in the lead up to todayâs race, both he and Jockey Yeung considered the horse to be a strong chance as it had worked particularly well.  He said although up in grade today, he did feel that LUCKY GIRL would benefit from having a light weight, so he was not concerned with the step up in class.  He added he was disappointed with the manner in which LUCKY GIRL finished off the race, particularly given the way the horse weakened over the final 200 Metres.  A veterinary inspection of LUCKY GIRL immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of LUCKY GIRL was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, LUCKY GIRL will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

When questioned, K Teetan stated that he had been asked to obtain a forward position on HOLY STAR.

He said therefore he allowed HOLY STAR to continue forward in order to cross MALAYAN PEARL.  He said he had to ride his mount along at this time, but having in mind the way MALAYAN PEARL was being steadied, it was likely that he would just be able to improve his position forward of MALAYAN PEARL and cross into the lead without having to pressure his horse.  He added however that MALAYAN PEARL was not able to be steadied and maintained its position inside HOLY STAR and therefore he was obliged to continue to race outside that horse and slightly in advance of MALAYAN PEARL until after the 1000 Metres at which time he was able to steady HOLY STAR to race directly to the outside of MALAYAN PEARL.

When questioned, K Teetan (DESIGNS ON ROME) stated that todayâs race was run at a good tempo in the early stages and he was hoping that the pace would ease after the 1000 Metres as it did at its last start when DESIGNS ON ROME was successful.  He said however that, unlike at its most recent start, the tempo of the race did not slacken and DESIGNS ON ROME, despite having quickened nicely after the 800 Metres, was not able to improve into the race as well as he had anticipated it would.

When questioned, A Badel stated that he had viewed some of CHOICE EXCHEQUER's previous races and had noted that when CHOICE EXCHEQUER had been attempted to be steadied, the horse had travelled keenly and he was asked to ensure that the horse travelled comfortably in today's race.  He said after obtaining the lead in the early stages, CHOICE EXCHEQUER was travelling comfortably, however, after the 1600 Metres was racing at a quicker tempo than he had hoped.  He said although he was aware that the tempo he was setting was genuine during this part of the race, he was reluctant to attempt to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER too much to ensure that the horse remained as relaxed as possible in the circumstances.  He said he was also reluctant to direct CHOICE EXCHEQUER to race on the rail as the horse was travelling in a relaxed manner racing one horse away from the rail.  He added as this principally occurred along the Back Straight, he was not overly concerned about not racing on the rail.  A Badel was cautioned against raising his whip arm above the height of his shoulder.
A veterinary inspection of MY FOLKS immediately following the race found that horse to be distressed and an endoscopic examination also showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.

Throughout the race, FRANCE VALOUR travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight was eased down.  A veterinary inspection of FRANCE VALOUR immediately following the race found that horse to have bled from both nostrils.
When questioned, A Badel stated that he had viewed some of CHOICE EXCHEQUER's previous races and had noted that when CHOICE EXCHEQUER had been attempted to be steadied, the horse had travelled keenly and he was asked to ensure that the horse travelled comfortably in today's race.  He said after obtaining the lead in the early stages, CHOICE EXCHEQUER was travelling comfortably, however, after the 1600 Metres was racing at a quicker tempo than he had hoped.  He said although he was aware that the tempo he was setting was genuine during this part of the race, he was reluctant to attempt to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER too much to ensure that the horse remained as relaxed as possible in the circumstances.  He said he was also reluctant to direct CHOICE EXCHEQUER to race on the rail as the horse was travelling in a relaxed manner racing one horse away from the rail.  He added as this principally occurred along the Back Straight, he was not overly concerned about not racing on the rail.  A Badel was cautioned against raising his whip arm above the height of his shoulder.
A veterinary inspection of MY FOLKS immediately following the race found that horse to be distressed and an endoscopic examination also showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, MY FOLKS will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

Then passing the 200 Metres, GLAMOROUS RYDER was momentarily eased away from the heels of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN (S Clipperton) which shifted out to obtain clear running.  S Clipperton was advised to exercise more care when shifting ground.
Approaching the 100 Metres, TELEPHATIA and KERKENI brushed.
Throughout the race, FRANCE VALOUR travelled wide and without cover and in the Straight was eased down.  A veterinary inspection of FRANCE VALOUR immediately following the race found that horse to have bled from both nostrils.
When questioned, A Badel stated that he had viewed some of CHOICE EXCHEQUER's previous races and had noted that when CHOICE EXCHEQUER had been attempted to be steadied, the horse had travelled keenly and he was asked to ensure that the horse travelled comfortably in today's race.  He said after obtaining the lead in the early stages, CHOICE EXCHEQUER was travelling comfortably, however, after the 1600 Metres was racing at a quicker tempo than he had hoped.  He said although he was aware that the tempo he was setting was genuine during this part of the race, he was reluctant to attempt to steady CHOICE EXCHEQUER too much to ensure that the horse remained as relaxed as possible in the circumstances.  He said he was also reluctant to direct CHOICE EXCHEQUER to race on the rail as the horse was travelling in a relaxed manner racing one horse away from the rail.  He added as this principally occurred along the Back Straight, he was not overly concerned about not racing on the rail.  A Badel was cautioned against raising his whip arm above the height of his shoulder.
A veterinary inspection of MY FOLKS immediately following the race found that horse to be distressed and an endoscopic examination also showed a substantial amount of blood in the horse's trachea.  Before being allowed to race again, MY FOLKS will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
MY FOLKS, ROCK THE TREE and HIGH SPEED METRO were sent for sampling.

                Trainer C W Chang was fined the sum of $3,000 for presenting MY FOLKS in the Parade Ring with a tongue tie which was not part of the horse's declared gear.
Trainer C W Chang pleaded guilty to a charge under Rule 155(5) of inappropriate behaviour, the inappropriate behaviour being that in the vicinity of the saddling stalls located in the Parade Ring prior to this race, he directed inappropriate language and made inappropriate contact with members of his stable staff.  For this offence, Mr Chang was fined the sum of $10,000.
On entering the track, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN made contact with a running rail.  On arrival at the Start, LOYAL CRAFTSMAN was examined by the Veterinary Officer who said in his opinion it was suitable to race.

Approaching the 700 Metres, KERKENI was steadied away from the heels of SWEET BEAN.
Rounding the Home Turn, VIVACIOUS WINNER was awkwardly placed inside the heels of FRANCE VALOUR which was giving ground.
Approaching the 300 Metres, GLAMOROUS RYDER and TELEPHATIA bumped.
Passing the 300 Metres, VIVACIOUS WINNER was momentarily eased away from the heels of LOYAL CRAFTSMAN which shifted out.
SWEET BEAN had difficulty obtaining clear running in the early part of the Straight and approaching the 200 Metres was steadied away from the heels of KERKENI which was eased to avoid the heels of ROCK THE TREE (B Prebble) which shifted in.  B Prebble was reprimanded and advised to ensure that he is sufficiently clear when shifting ground.  At the same point, GLAMOROUS RYDER shifted out and bumped TELEPHATIA, resulting in both horses becoming unbalanced.

Shortly after the start, ROCK THE TREE shifted out and bumped FANCY MUSIC.
From wide barriers, AEROLUMINANCE and AGIAAL were steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.

Approaching and passing the 1400 Metres, BEST REWARD proved difficult to settle and was awkwardly placed behind ASHKIYR.
After the 500 Metres, ROCK THE TREE and AEROLUMINANCE bumped.  After this, ROCK THE TREE and AEROLUMINANCE raced tight and near the 400 Metres again bumped after which AEROLUMINANCE got its head on the side and lay in, resulting in ROCK THE TREE being awkwardly placed outside the heels of AGIAAL.  AEROLUMINANCE continued to lay in and proved difficult to ride for a considerable distance after this.  After being bumped by AEROLUMINANCE approaching the 300 Metres, ROCK THE TREE hung in.
Passing the 150 Metres, B Prebble (ROCK THE TREE) dropped his whip.
Passing the 50 Metres, SUPER FORM was inconvenienced when awkwardly placed inside the heels of XINJIANG YARN which lay in under pressure.
Approaching the finishing line, BEST REWARD was awkwardly placed close to the heels of ASHKIYR and consequently was not able to be properly tested.
Close to the finishing line, HAPPY AND HEALTHY was awkwardly placed close to the heels of TERRIFIC MASTER and consequently was not able to be ridden out all the way to the end of the race.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of FANCY MUSIC, Z Purton stated that as at its last start when the horse began well it was hoped that, because of the makeup of the field, FANCY MUSIC may be able to obtain a position about midfield or just worse than midfield with cover.  He said however that ROCK THE TREE improved its position inside FANCY MUSIC after the 1800 Metres and because of this FANCY HORSE was left racing wide and without cover and after the 1500 Metres without cover.  He said FANCY MUSIC did not travel well at any stage of the race and, in his opinion, did not appear to be as confident on the surface as it was at its last start when successful.  He added FANCY MUSIC came under heavy pressure near the 600 Metres and then, despite being ridden out, gave ground.  He said the horse became unbalanced in its action near the 300 Metres and after this he eased it down, however, FANCY MUSIC was already well beaten at this time.  A veterinary inspection of FANCY MUSIC immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of FANCY MUSIC, a last start winner, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, FANCY MUSIC will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

                ENSURING was slow to begin.
From the outside barrier, ENORMOUS HONOUR was steadied in the early stages and shifted across behind runners.
At the 1800 Metres, RAZOR QUEST proved very difficult to settle and got its head up when being checked away from the heels of UP AND COMING.  Then after the 1800 Metres, RAZOR QUEST, which continued to prove very difficult to settle, shifted out away from the heels of UP AND COMING, resulting in SHARP SAILOR momentarily racing tight between RAZOR QUEST and GREEN DISPATCH.  RAZOR QUEST continued to prove difficult to settle and near the 1700 Metres again got its head up when racing in restricted room between UP AND COMING and GREEN DISPATCH.  In this incident, RAZOR QUEST lost ground, resulting in SHARP SAILOR being shifted out away from the heels of that horse.  SHARP SAILOR was consequently left racing wide and without cover and was allowed to improve its position around RAZOR QUEST to obtain cover passing the 1200 Metres.
When questioned regarding his riding of HAPPY ROCKY approaching and rounding the Home Turn, K C Leung stated that passing the 500 Metres he was positioned behind and to the inside of SHARP SAILOR.  He said at this time SHARP SAILOR came under pressure and he remained racing to the inside of that horse with a view to following GREEN DISPATCH into the Straight in the event that SHARP SAILOR commenced to give ground.  He said at the entrance to the Straight UP AND COMING, which was racing on the rail, came away from the rail to follow GREEN DISPATCH and as SHARP SAILOR was continuing to hold its position, he steadied HAPPY ROCKY and directed it away from the heels of SHARP SAILOR to obtain a run between that horse and RAZOR QUEST.

Z Purton (BEST REWARD) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that approaching the 100 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of TERRIFIC MASTER, resulting in that horse having to be checked away from the heels of BEST REWARD and losing the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  Z Purton was suspended from riding in races for a period to commence on Sunday, 28 May 2017 and to expire on Thursday, 1 June 2017 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into account Jockey Purtonâs good race riding record.
Near the 75 Metres, BLAZING PASS was directed out away from the heels of GARLIC YEAH to continue improving.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that as BEST EFFORT was stepping up in distance to 2000 Metres for the first time, it was anticipated that the horse would have sufficient natural early speed to take up a forward position from barrier 3.  He said he was therefore asked to let the horse use its early speed and allow it to obtain a forward position without riding it along  He said BEST EFFORT was crowded for room on jumping between PO CHING TREASURE and ASHKIYR, both of which shifted ground and this resulted in him having to ride BEST EFFORT along for a short distance to ensure that it maintained its position between those horses.  He said after this BEST EFFORT was able to obtain a forward position outside PO CHING TREASURE without having to be ridden along.  He added when PO CHING TREASURE was hard ridden to his inside, he remained racing outside that horse and commenced to steady his mount after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said when he did this BEST EFFORT commenced to travel keenly and would not relax until near the 1400 Metres.
When questioned regarding his riding of CLOUD NINE after the 1600 Metres, K Teetan stated that, from the outside barrier, he had been asked to ride the horse positively in the early stages to obtain a forward position as it had previously been successful when ridden in this manner.  He said it was explained to him that CLOUD NINE is one-paced and therefore leading would give it the best opportunity to finish off the race strongly.  He said he had to ride his mount aggressively to cross runners to his inside and after passing the winning post on the first occasion was left racing in a position three wide and without cover.  He said as the tempo of the race was quite genuine in the early stages, he elected to attempt to obtain a trailing position behind BEST EFFORT passing the 1600 Metres rather than continue to race wide and without cover.  He said as he was doing this, the leaders slackened the tempo marginally and as CLOUD NINE was proving difficult to steady to obtain a trailing position behind BEST EFFORT, he therefore allowed his mount to improve forward of BEST EFFORT approaching the 1200 Metres.  He said after shifting in to race outside the leader PO CHING TREASURE, he felt that as that horse had earlier been steadied, he therefore believed that there was an opportunity to use CLOUD NINEâs momentum to continue forward and cross PO CHING TREASURE.  He said however that after the 1000 Metres PO CHING TREASURE was ridden to maintain its position to the inside of CLOUD NINE, however, as the horse at this time had its momentum up, he elected to continue forward of that horse to lead rather than remain racing outside PO CHING TREASURE.  K Teetan was advised that, having regard to the sectionals of the race after the 1200 Metres, in the opinion of the Stewards, it would have been in CLOUD NINEâs best interests to remain racing to the outside of PO CHING TREASURE rather than continue to go forward on that horse.  K Teetan was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they can close off their race as best as they are able.

He said as he was doing this, the leaders slackened the tempo marginally and as CLOUD NINE was proving difficult to steady to obtain a trailing position behind BEST EFFORT, he therefore allowed his mount to improve forward of BEST EFFORT approaching the 1200 Metres.  He said after shifting in to race outside the leader PO CHING TREASURE, he felt that as that horse had earlier been steadied, he therefore believed that there was an opportunity to use CLOUD NINEâs momentum to continue forward and cross PO CHING TREASURE.  He said however that after the 1000 Metres PO CHING TREASURE was ridden to maintain its position to the inside of CLOUD NINE, however, as the horse at this time had its momentum up, he elected to continue forward of that horse to lead rather than remain racing outside PO CHING TREASURE.  K Teetan was advised that, having regard to the sectionals of the race after the 1200 Metres, in the opinion of the Stewards, it would have been in CLOUD NINEâs best interests to remain racing to the outside of PO CHING TREASURE rather than continue to go forward on that horse.  K Teetan was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they can close off their race as best as they are able.

Z Purton (BEST REWARD) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that approaching the 100 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of TERRIFIC MASTER, resulting in that horse having to be checked away from the heels of BEST REWARD and losing the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  Z Purton was suspended from riding in races for a period to commence on Sunday, 28 May 2017 and to expire on Thursday, 1 June 2017 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).

When questioned, M L Yeung stated that as BEST EFFORT was stepping up in distance to 2000 Metres for the first time, it was anticipated that the horse would have sufficient natural early speed to take up a forward position from barrier 3.  He said he was therefore asked to let the horse use its early speed and allow it to obtain a forward position without riding it along  He said BEST EFFORT was crowded for room on jumping between PO CHING TREASURE and ASHKIYR, both of which shifted ground and this resulted in him having to ride BEST EFFORT along for a short distance to ensure that it maintained its position between those horses.  He said after this BEST EFFORT was able to obtain a forward position outside PO CHING TREASURE without having to be ridden along.  He added when PO CHING TREASURE was hard ridden to his inside, he remained racing outside that horse and commenced to steady his mount after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said when he did this BEST EFFORT commenced to travel keenly and would not relax until near the 1400 Metres.
When questioned regarding his riding of CLOUD NINE after the 1600 Metres, K Teetan stated that, from the outside barrier, he had been asked to ride the horse positively in the early stages to obtain a forward position as it had previously been successful when ridden in this manner.

K Teetan was further advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they can close off their race as best as they are able.

Z Purton (BEST REWARD) pleaded guilty to a charge of careless riding [Rule 100(1)] in that approaching the 100 Metres he permitted his mount to shift out when not clear of TERRIFIC MASTER, resulting in that horse having to be checked away from the heels of BEST REWARD and losing the running to which it was rightfully entitled.  Z Purton was suspended from riding in races for a period to commence on Sunday, 28 May 2017 and to expire on Thursday, 1 June 2017 on which day he may resume race riding (2 Hong Kong racedays).  In assessing penalty, the Stewards took into account Jockey Purtonâs good race riding record.
Near the 75 Metres, BLAZING PASS was directed out away from the heels of GARLIC YEAH to continue improving.
When questioned, M L Yeung stated that as BEST EFFORT was stepping up in distance to 2000 Metres for the first time, it was anticipated that the horse would have sufficient natural early speed to take up a forward position from barrier 3.  He said he was therefore asked to let the horse use its early speed and allow it to obtain a forward position without riding it along  He said BEST EFFORT was crowded for room on jumping between PO CHING TREASURE and ASHKIYR, both of which shifted ground and this resulted in him having to ride BEST EFFORT along for a short distance to ensure that it maintained its position between those horses.  He said after this BEST EFFORT was able to obtain a forward position outside PO CHING TREASURE without having to be ridden along.  He added when PO CHING TREASURE was hard ridden to his inside, he remained racing outside that horse and commenced to steady his mount after passing the winning post on the first occasion.  He said when he did this BEST EFFORT commenced to travel keenly and would not relax until near the 1400 Metres.
When questioned regarding his riding of CLOUD NINE after the 1600 Metres, K Teetan stated that, from the outside barrier, he had been asked to ride the horse positively in the early stages to obtain a forward position as it had previously been successful when ridden in this manner.  He said it was explained to him that CLOUD NINE is one-paced and therefore leading would give it the best opportunity to finish off the race strongly.  He said he had to ride his mount aggressively to cross runners to his inside and after passing the winning post on the first occasion was left racing in a position three wide and without cover.  He said as the tempo of the race was quite genuine in the early stages, he elected to attempt to obtain a trailing position behind BEST EFFORT passing the 1600 Metres rather than continue to race wide and without cover.  He said as he was doing this, the leaders slackened the tempo marginally and as CLOUD NINE was proving difficult to steady to obtain a trailing position behind BEST EFFORT, he therefore allowed his mount to improve forward of BEST EFFORT approaching the 1200 Metres.  He said after shifting in to race outside the leader PO CHING TREASURE, he felt that as that horse had earlier been steadied, he therefore believed that there was an opportunity to use CLOUD NINEâs momentum to continue forward and cross PO CHING TREASURE.

When questioned, Apprentice H T Mo (SHARP SAILOR) stated that after the 1300 Metres his mount commenced to travel keenly and shifted out away from the heels of JOLLY GENE and bumped BULLISH GLORY.  He said after this SHARP SAILOR continued to travel keenly.  He said after the 1200 Metres a margin developed between SHARP SAILOR and JOLLY GENE and as BULLISH GLORY was attempting to shift in behind JOLLY GENE, he was reluctant to ride his mount along at this stage to maintain his position having regard to the manner in which the horse had been previously over-racing.  Apprentice Mo was advised that his explanation would be reported, however, he should, wherever circumstances permit, make every endeavour to maintain favourable positions. 
A veterinary inspection of BEST REWARD immediately following the race found that horse to be lame in its left front leg.  Before being allowed to race again, BEST REWARD will be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
BEST REWARD, JOLLY GENE and GORGEOUS AGAIN were sent for sampling.

ANDOYAS was slow to begin.
GENERAL SHERMAN began awkwardly and then was crowded for room with RENAISSANCE ART between PRAWN BABA which shifted in marginally and ROCKETEER which shifted out.
Passing the 1700 Metres, ANDOYAS raced tight between HAPPILABABY and HELENE CHARISMA.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, SUPREME PROFIT shifted out marginally and made heavy contact with the hindquarters of BASIC TRILOGY which was laying in.  This resulted in BASIC TRILOGY becoming badly unbalanced and being turned in across the running of SUPREME PROFIT, causing that horse to be checked.  When SUPREME PROFIT was checked, that horse shifted in and bumped PRAWN BABA which in turn shifted in and bumped RENAISSANCE ART.  GENERAL SHERMAN, which was racing to the inside of RENAISSANCE ART, was steadied when crowded for room between RENAISSANCE ART and ROCKETEER and in doing so became badly unbalanced.  After being turned in across SUPREME PROFIT, BASIC TRILOGY was then awkwardly placed inside the heels of GREEN DISPATCH (Apprentice H T Mo) which, when being ridden along, got its head on the side and lay in.  In this incident, Apprentice Mo stopped riding GREEN DISPATCH and attempted to shift that horse out to relieve the tightening to BASIC TRILOGY.  Apprentice Mo was advised that whilst the primary reason for SUPREME PROFIT being checked was as a result of contact on the hindquarters by BASIC TRILOGY, nonetheless in similar circumstances he must ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground
HAPPILABABY lost its right hind plate near the 450 Metres.
Passing the 400 Metres, DINOZZO was shifted out away from the heels of DOYENI which shifted in when awkwardly placed inside the heels of PRAWN BABA.  DINOZZO was then held up for clear running from near the 350 Metres until passing the 300 Metres.  DOYENI also had difficulty obtaining clear running until near the 250 Metres.
DINOZZO was again badly held up for clear running over the final 150 Metres and consequently was not able to be tested.
PRAWN BABA raced in restricted room between DOYENI and ROCKETEER over the concluding stages and was not able to be fully tested.
HELENE CHARISMA hung in badly in the Straight and proved difficult to ride and passing the 200 Metres shifted in and bumped the hindquarters of GENERAL SHERMAN which became unbalanced.  HELENE CHARISMA continued to hang in and raced tight outside GENERAL SHERMAN for some distance and then passing the 100 Metres hung in further, resulting in GENERAL SHERMAN being crowded onto ROCKETEER which became unbalanced after being bumped by GENERAL SHERMAN.  During this incident, Z Purton was not able to properly test HELENE CHARISMA due to the horseâs racing manners which were considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HELENE CHARISMA will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial.
BASIC TRILOGY lost its right front plate after the race.
When questioned regarding the tempo he set on GREEN DISPATCH, particularly between the 1600 Metres and the 1200 Metres, Apprentice H T Mo stated that he was able to cross DOYENI after the 1700 Metres and then immediately took hold of his mount in an endeavour to steady the tempo.  He said when BASIC TRILOGY improved to be racing outside GREEN DISPATCH after the 1500 Metres, his mount commenced to travel keenly, however, he did not realize that he was setting as fast a tempo as he was at this time.  He said after having been made aware of the sectionals of the race after the 1600 Metres, he believed that in retrospect he had erred in not making more of an effort to steady the tempo during this part of the race.  Apprentice Mo, in the presence of his allocated trainer, Mr C S Shum, was told that as an apprentice who has had a good deal of experience both in Hong Kong and overseas, he should have been more aware of the tempo that he set on GREEN DISPATCH.  He was advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to finish off their race to the best of their ability.
The Stewards will interview S Clipperton, the rider of PRAWN BABA, regarding his riding of that horse from the 600 Metres prior to the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 12 July 2017.
A veterinary inspection of BASIC TRILOGY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of BASIC TRILOGY, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BASIC TRILOGY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

<12/7/2017 9 July 2017 Sha Tin Racemeeting â Race 9 (787)>The Stewards tonight questioned S Clipperton regarding his riding of PRAWN BABA, particularly approaching and passing the 600 Metres. S Clipperton stated that it had been explained to him that PRAWN BABA is one-paced and benefits from a truly run race. He also stated that he was instructed to ride PRAWN BABA positively in the early stages to take up a prominent position and to ensure that the horse was provided with clear and unimpeded running from straightening. He said the middle stages of the race were run at a good tempo, however, the pace of the race slackened after the 1200 Metres. He said passing the 800 Metres when racing behind GREEN DISPATCH and inside BASIC TRILOGY, PRAWN BABA appeared to come off the bridle and he had to ride it along from the 800 Metres to ensure that PRAWN BABA maintained its position behind GREEN DISPATCH. He said as PRAWN BABA is one-paced, he did not wish to be left racing behind GREEN DISPATCH and BASIC TRILOGY after the 600 Metres as he felt that the horse would have its best chance if he were to make the race into a staying test as he did not believe he could outsprint ROCKETETEER if PRAWN BABA was not able to establish a margin over that horse. He said for these reasons he commenced to ride PRAWN BABA aggressively from the 600 Metres to ensure that the principal chances in the race would have to make ground on PRAWN BABA whilst also ensuring the race did not become a sit and sprint race. He added whilst this resulted in PRAWN BABA having to be ridden along earlier in the race than would normally be the case, he believed that riding the horse in this manner would give it the best opportunity to finish in front of the principal chances in the race. Mr J Size, the trainer of PRAWN BABA, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Clipperton and stated that, after reviewing the race and all the circumstances of the race, he was satisfied with Jockey Clippertonâs riding of PRAWN BABA.

Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, SUPREME PROFIT shifted out marginally and made heavy contact with the hindquarters of BASIC TRILOGY which was laying in.  This resulted in BASIC TRILOGY becoming badly unbalanced and being turned in across the running of SUPREME PROFIT, causing that horse to be checked.  When SUPREME PROFIT was checked, that horse shifted in and bumped PRAWN BABA which in turn shifted in and bumped RENAISSANCE ART.  GENERAL SHERMAN, which was racing to the inside of RENAISSANCE ART, was steadied when crowded for room between RENAISSANCE ART and ROCKETEER and in doing so became badly unbalanced.  After being turned in across SUPREME PROFIT, BASIC TRILOGY was then awkwardly placed inside the heels of GREEN DISPATCH (Apprentice H T Mo) which, when being ridden along, got its head on the side and lay in.  In this incident, Apprentice Mo stopped riding GREEN DISPATCH and attempted to shift that horse out to relieve the tightening to BASIC TRILOGY.  Apprentice Mo was advised that whilst the primary reason for SUPREME PROFIT being checked was as a result of contact on the hindquarters by BASIC TRILOGY, nonetheless in similar circumstances he must ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground
HAPPILABABY lost its right hind plate near the 450 Metres.
Passing the 400 Metres, DINOZZO was shifted out away from the heels of DOYENI which shifted in when awkwardly placed inside the heels of PRAWN BABA.  DINOZZO was then held up for clear running from near the 350 Metres until passing the 300 Metres.  DOYENI also had difficulty obtaining clear running until near the 250 Metres.
DINOZZO was again badly held up for clear running over the final 150 Metres and consequently was not able to be tested.
PRAWN BABA raced in restricted room between DOYENI and ROCKETEER over the concluding stages and was not able to be fully tested.
HELENE CHARISMA hung in badly in the Straight and proved difficult to ride and passing the 200 Metres shifted in and bumped the hindquarters of GENERAL SHERMAN which became unbalanced.  HELENE CHARISMA continued to hang in and raced tight outside GENERAL SHERMAN for some distance and then passing the 100 Metres hung in further, resulting in GENERAL SHERMAN being crowded onto ROCKETEER which became unbalanced after being bumped by GENERAL SHERMAN.  During this incident, Z Purton was not able to properly test HELENE CHARISMA due to the horseâs racing manners which were considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HELENE CHARISMA will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial.
BASIC TRILOGY lost its right front plate after the race.
When questioned regarding the tempo he set on GREEN DISPATCH, particularly between the 1600 Metres and the 1200 Metres, Apprentice H T Mo stated that he was able to cross DOYENI after the 1700 Metres and then immediately took hold of his mount in an endeavour to steady the tempo.  He said when BASIC TRILOGY improved to be racing outside GREEN DISPATCH after the 1500 Metres, his mount commenced to travel keenly, however, he did not realize that he was setting as fast a tempo as he was at this time.  He said after having been made aware of the sectionals of the race after the 1600 Metres, he believed that in retrospect he had erred in not making more of an effort to steady the tempo during this part of the race.  Apprentice Mo, in the presence of his allocated trainer, Mr C S Shum, was told that as an apprentice who has had a good deal of experience both in Hong Kong and overseas, he should have been more aware of the tempo that he set on GREEN DISPATCH.  He was advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to finish off their race to the best of their ability.
The Stewards will interview S Clipperton, the rider of PRAWN BABA, regarding his riding of that horse from the 600 Metres prior to the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 12 July 2017.
A veterinary inspection of BASIC TRILOGY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of BASIC TRILOGY, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BASIC TRILOGY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
GENERAL SHERMAN and ROCKETEER were sent for sampling.
<12/7/2017 9 July 2017 Sha Tin Racemeeting â Race 9 (787)>The Stewards tonight questioned S Clipperton regarding his riding of PRAWN BABA, particularly approaching and passing the 600 Metres. S Clipperton stated that it had been explained to him that PRAWN BABA is one-paced and benefits from a truly run race. He also stated that he was instructed to ride PRAWN BABA positively in the early stages to take up a prominent position and to ensure that the horse was provided with clear and unimpeded running from straightening. He said the middle stages of the race were run at a good tempo, however, the pace of the race slackened after the 1200 Metres. He said passing the 800 Metres when racing behind GREEN DISPATCH and inside BASIC TRILOGY, PRAWN BABA appeared to come off the bridle and he had to ride it along from the 800 Metres to ensure that PRAWN BABA maintained its position behind GREEN DISPATCH. He said as PRAWN BABA is one-paced, he did not wish to be left racing behind GREEN DISPATCH and BASIC TRILOGY after the 600 Metres as he felt that the horse would have its best chance if he were to make the race into a staying test as he did not believe he could outsprint ROCKETETEER if PRAWN BABA was not able to establish a margin over that horse. He said for these reasons he commenced to ride PRAWN BABA aggressively from the 600 Metres to ensure that the principal chances in the race would have to make ground on PRAWN BABA whilst also ensuring the race did not become a sit and sprint race. He added whilst this resulted in PRAWN BABA having to be ridden along earlier in the race than would normally be the case, he believed that riding the horse in this manner would give it the best opportunity to finish in front of the principal chances in the race. Mr J Size, the trainer of PRAWN BABA, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Clipperton and stated that, after reviewing the race and all the circumstances of the race, he was satisfied with Jockey Clippertonâs riding of PRAWN BABA.

During this incident, Z Purton was not able to properly test HELENE CHARISMA due to the horseâs racing manners which were considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, HELENE CHARISMA will be required to perform satisfactorily in a barrier trial.
BASIC TRILOGY lost its right front plate after the race.
When questioned regarding the tempo he set on GREEN DISPATCH, particularly between the 1600 Metres and the 1200 Metres, Apprentice H T Mo stated that he was able to cross DOYENI after the 1700 Metres and then immediately took hold of his mount in an endeavour to steady the tempo.  He said when BASIC TRILOGY improved to be racing outside GREEN DISPATCH after the 1500 Metres, his mount commenced to travel keenly, however, he did not realize that he was setting as fast a tempo as he was at this time.  He said after having been made aware of the sectionals of the race after the 1600 Metres, he believed that in retrospect he had erred in not making more of an effort to steady the tempo during this part of the race.  Apprentice Mo, in the presence of his allocated trainer, Mr C S Shum, was told that as an apprentice who has had a good deal of experience both in Hong Kong and overseas, he should have been more aware of the tempo that he set on GREEN DISPATCH.  He was advised to ensure that he rides his mounts in such a manner so that they are able to finish off their race to the best of their ability.
The Stewards will interview S Clipperton, the rider of PRAWN BABA, regarding his riding of that horse from the 600 Metres prior to the Happy Valley racemeeting on Wednesday, 12 July 2017.
A veterinary inspection of BASIC TRILOGY immediately following the race did not show any significant findings.  The performance of BASIC TRILOGY, which finished tailed out, was considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BASIC TRILOGY will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.

<12/7/2017 9 July 2017 Sha Tin Racemeeting â Race 9 (787)>The Stewards tonight questioned S Clipperton regarding his riding of PRAWN BABA, particularly approaching and passing the 600 Metres. S Clipperton stated that it had been explained to him that PRAWN BABA is one-paced and benefits from a truly run race. He also stated that he was instructed to ride PRAWN BABA positively in the early stages to take up a prominent position and to ensure that the horse was provided with clear and unimpeded running from straightening. He said the middle stages of the race were run at a good tempo, however, the pace of the race slackened after the 1200 Metres. He said passing the 800 Metres when racing behind GREEN DISPATCH and inside BASIC TRILOGY, PRAWN BABA appeared to come off the bridle and he had to ride it along from the 800 Metres to ensure that PRAWN BABA maintained its position behind GREEN DISPATCH. He said as PRAWN BABA is one-paced, he did not wish to be left racing behind GREEN DISPATCH and BASIC TRILOGY after the 600 Metres as he felt that the horse would have its best chance if he were to make the race into a staying test as he did not believe he could outsprint ROCKETETEER if PRAWN BABA was not able to establish a margin over that horse. He said for these reasons he commenced to ride PRAWN BABA aggressively from the 600 Metres to ensure that the principal chances in the race would have to make ground on PRAWN BABA whilst also ensuring the race did not become a sit and sprint race. He added whilst this resulted in PRAWN BABA having to be ridden along earlier in the race than would normally be the case, he believed that riding the horse in this manner would give it the best opportunity to finish in front of the principal chances in the race. Mr J Size, the trainer of PRAWN BABA, confirmed the instructions given to Jockey Clipperton and stated that, after reviewing the race and all the circumstances of the race, he was satisfied with Jockey Clippertonâs riding of PRAWN BABA.

ANDOYAS was slow to begin.
GENERAL SHERMAN began awkwardly and then was crowded for room with RENAISSANCE ART between PRAWN BABA which shifted in marginally and ROCKETEER which shifted out.
Passing the 1700 Metres, ANDOYAS raced tight between HAPPILABABY and HELENE CHARISMA.
Approaching the winning post on the first occasion, SUPREME PROFIT shifted out marginally and made heavy contact with the hindquarters of BASIC TRILOGY which was laying in.  This resulted in BASIC TRILOGY becoming badly unbalanced and being turned in across the running of SUPREME PROFIT, causing that horse to be checked.  When SUPREME PROFIT was checked, that horse shifted in and bumped PRAWN BABA which in turn shifted in and bumped RENAISSANCE ART.  GENERAL SHERMAN, which was racing to the inside of RENAISSANCE ART, was steadied when crowded for room between RENAISSANCE ART and ROCKETEER and in doing so became badly unbalanced.  After being turned in across SUPREME PROFIT, BASIC TRILOGY was then awkwardly placed inside the heels of GREEN DISPATCH (Apprentice H T Mo) which, when being ridden along, got its head on the side and lay in.  In this incident, Apprentice Mo stopped riding GREEN DISPATCH and attempted to shift that horse out to relieve the tightening to BASIC TRILOGY.  Apprentice Mo was advised that whilst the primary reason for SUPREME PROFIT being checked was as a result of contact on the hindquarters by BASIC TRILOGY, nonetheless in similar circumstances he must ensure that he makes every endeavour to prevent his mounts from shifting ground
HAPPILABABY lost its right hind plate near the 450 Metres.
Passing the 400 Metres, DINOZZO was shifted out away from the heels of DOYENI which shifted in when awkwardly placed inside the heels of PRAWN BABA.  DINOZZO was then held up for clear running from near the 350 Metres until passing the 300 Metres.  DOYENI also had difficulty obtaining clear running until near the 250 Metres.
DINOZZO was again badly held up for clear running over the final 150 Metres and consequently was not able to be tested.
PRAWN BABA raced in restricted room between DOYENI and ROCKETEER over the concluding stages and was not able to be fully tested.
HELENE CHARISMA hung in badly in the Straight and proved difficult to ride and passing the 200 Metres shifted in and bumped the hindquarters of GENERAL SHERMAN which became unbalanced.  HELENE CHARISMA continued to hang in and raced tight outside GENERAL SHERMAN for some distance and then passing the 100 Metres hung in further, resulting in GENERAL SHERMAN being crowded onto ROCKETEER which became unbalanced after being bumped by GENERAL SHERMAN.
