T Berry was suspended from riding in races for a period to expire on Thursday, 9 July 2015 on which day he may resume race riding (6 Hong Kong racedays).

Immediately after the running of this race, the Stewards became aware that CANNOCK CHASE, saddle cloth number 3, had been inadvertently signalled as the 3rd placegetter in this race rather than DARIYAN, saddle cloth number 13, which did in fact finish 3rd.  This matter was rectified by the Judge a short time later with DARIYAN correctly being signalled as the 3rd placegetter.  Prior to the declaration of weighed-in, the Stewards confirmed that the betting system would pay out on the correct numbers and accordingly weighed-in was semaphored at the normal time.

He said he had hoped that the tempo may steady up in the middle stages which would provide the opportunity for MILITARY ATTACK to improve its position, however, it was not until after the 500 Metres that the horse was able to commence to improve.  He added after being placed under pressure in the early part of the Straight, MILITARY ATTACK again felt reluctant to stretch out and as the horse did not feel comfortable in its action, he rode it out only hands and heels over the concluding stages.  After the race, the Veterinary Officer reported that MILITARY ATTACK was lame in its left front leg.

                ANTICIPATION, which was kicked by another runner in the Parade Ring, was examined by the Veterinary Officer on arrival at the Start who said the horse was suitable to race.
GOLD MOUNT and HELENE CHARISMA began only fairly.
BEAUTY GENERATION lost its right front plate after the 2300 Metres.
Despite being hard ridden along in the early stages, BASIC TRILOGY failed to muster speed and subsequently travelled wide and without cover for the majority of the race.
In the early stages, ANTICIPATION travelled wide and without cover and after the 1600 Metres was allowed to improve its position to race outside the lead by the 1400 Metres.
Passing the winning post on the first occasion, SUPREME PROFIT became unbalanced and lost ground when crowded for room between BASIC TRILOGY (S Clipperton) which shifted in before being shifted back out to relieve the tightening to SUPREME PROFIT and ANDOYAS which shifted out away from the heels of EAGLE WAY which got its head on the side and shifted out marginally.  S Clipperton was advised to ensure that he leaves comfortable racing rom for runners to his inside in similar circumstances.
Near the 650 Metres, PRAWN BABA, which was being ridden along to improve its position around EAGLE WAY, was bumped by that horse which shifted out away from the heels of HELENE SUPER STAR.
Near the 350 Metres, HELENE SUPER STAR was bumped by ANTICIPATION which, when giving ground abruptly, shifted out away from GOLD MOUNT.
In the Straight, HELENE CHARISMA hung in and proved difficult to ride.
The performances of BASIC TRILOGY, ANTICIPATION, HAPPILABABY and HELENE SUPER STAR, which all finished tailed out, were considered unacceptable.  Before being allowed to race again, BASIC TRILOGY, ANTICIPATION, HAPPILABABY and HELENE SUPER STAR will be required to perform to the satisfaction of the Stewards in a barrier trial and be subjected to an official veterinary examination.
When questioned regarding the disappointing performance of BEAUTY GENERATION, Z Purton stated that although the tempo was good for the majority of the race, BEAUTY GENERATION would not settle and travelled keenly.  He said the horse had been relaxed it its track work in the lead up to todayâs race, however, due to BEAUTY GENERATION racing too keenly it then did not finish off the race.  A veterinary inspection of BEAUTY GENERATION immediately following the race found that horse to have sustained a small overreach cut to the right front heel.
