IMPORTANT NOTES: 
################# 

This README file will contain a set of instructions in order to run code from "Run For The Money" project correctly. 

Make certain to keep all file headers and import libraries intact if originally present. 

Running time for project was 11th March - 11th May 2019.  



When running a notebook: 
#######################
The use of Jupyter Notebooks with Python 3.7 is recommended for this project.  
A specification file has been provided to allow anyone with this project to make an identical environment to the one we used to create this project in an attempt to ease reproducability. 

We have made every effort to ensure that running the code is as easy as possible.  
Within our project_files folder you will find a collection of .csv files that are used throughout the notebooks that contain the data used to answer our research questions.  


Order: 
############ 

Please run the notebooks in ascending numerical order: (DSIP 1100, DSIP 2100, DSIP 2200, etc).  


If any issue occurs in the running of our project do not hesitate to email andrew.mc-gurk@ucdconnect.ie or djowen777@gmail.com for assistance.  

Thanks!
